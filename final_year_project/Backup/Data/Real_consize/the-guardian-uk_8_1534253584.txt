Content :The US measures have accelerated a currency crisis in Turkey, though the lira rallied slightly on Tuesday, from a low of 7 against the dollar on Monday night to about 6.5 at noon (1000 BST) in Istanbul. “They do not refrain from using the economy as a weapon against us, as they tried in the areas of diplomacy, military, or efforts for social and political instability,” he said. Meanwhile, the American pastor Andrew Brunson, whose continued detention over espionage allegations provoked the latest crisis, said through his lawyer that he was appealing against his house arrest and travel ban. Brunson was detained in October 2016, three months after a failed coup attempt against the Turkish president , widely believed in Turkey to have been led by the exiled leader of the Gülen political movement, Fethullah Gülen, who has lived in the US state of Pennsylvania for the past two decades. Turkey’s central bank took measures on Monday to improve liquidity but they were seen as insufficient to stem the currency slide. He has said the judiciary will rule independently on the case, and any move to release Brunson could be seen domestically as caving in to Washington. Instead he has portrayed his country as under assault by external forces and as having been betrayed by a Nato ally. Late on Monday, Donald Trump signed a defence bill that would block Ankara’s access to the stealth F-35 fighter jet, which Turkey has helped build. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday that US sanctions against Ankara and Moscow were an illegitimate policy and a way for the US to obtain an unfair competitive advantage in global trade. Lavrov was speaking at a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in Ankara.
