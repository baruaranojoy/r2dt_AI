Content :MILAN -- A bridge on a main highway linking Italy with France collapsed Tuesday in the Italian port city of Genoa during a sudden, violent storm, sending vehicles plunging almost 300 feet into a heap of rubble below. Amalia Tedeschi, a firefighter, told RAI state TV that some 20 vehicles, including cars and trucks, had been involved in the collapse of a stretch of bridge some 260 yards in length. The Interior Ministry confirmed reports by the Italian news agency ANSA that 11 people were killed and five injured, adding that the number could increase. A photo provided by the Italian Red Cross shows a collapsed section of the raised A10 highway in Genoa, Italy, Aug. 14, 2018. Italian fire services said the bridge, in an industrial area in west Genoa, fell down at 5 a.m. Eastern time. The private broadcaster Sky TG24 said a 200-yard section of the Morandi Bridge collapsed over an industrial zone, sending tons of twisted steel and concrete debris onto warehouses below. Other images showed a green truck that had stopped just short of the gaping hole in the bridge and the tires of a tractor trailer in the rubble. The disaster occurred on a highway that connects Italy to France, and northern cities like Milan to the beaches of Liguria. Inaugurated in 1967, it is 295 feet high, just over half a mile long, with the longest section between supports measuring more than 200 yards. The collapse of the bridge comes eight days after another major accident on an Italian highway, one near the northern city of Bologna.
