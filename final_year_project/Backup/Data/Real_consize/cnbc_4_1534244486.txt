Content :Home Depot reaped the benefits of a warmer start to the summer, following a rocky spring season , and on Tuesday reported second-quarter earnings and sales that surpassed analysts' expectations. The home improvement retailer also raised its outlook for both revenue and same-store sales for the full year, as the number of customer transactions jumped during the latest period and shoppers are spending more at Home Depot stores overall. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters: Spring had a chilly start in much of the U.S. this year, prompting many homeowners in America to push back their gardening, remodeling and repair projects as far as into the summer. Home Depot sales have accelerated more broadly thanks to a strong housing market in the U.S. and favorable economic tailwinds. In previous quarters, the retailer has been helped by homeowners in recovery mode as they made repairs after severe storms such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria last year. The Atlanta-based retailer is meanwhile focused on growing its Pro business and believes that by bolstering its delivery platform it will be able to take a larger share of the professional homebuilder market. "Not only did our seasonal business rebound from the first quarter, but our overall results exceeded our expectations," Home Depot CEO Craig Menear said in a statement. Home Depot shares have climbed roughly 25 percent from a year ago, bringing the retailer's market cap to $223.9 billion. That's compared with Lowe's , which has a market cap of $79.2 billion, and its stock has risen about 26 percent since this time last year.
