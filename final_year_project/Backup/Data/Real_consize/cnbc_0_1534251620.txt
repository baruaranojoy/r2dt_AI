Tesla 's board has formed a special committee to evaluate CEO Elon Musk 's desire to go private, the company said Tuesday. The committee has not yet received a formal proposal from Musk, but it's another signal that the company is seriously considering the option. The special committee is composed of independent board members Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm and Linda Johnson Rice, Tesla said. Robyn Denholm is COO of telecommunications firm Telstra and previously held executive positions at system networks company Juniper. She also serves on the boards of Omnicom Group and food delivery service Grubhub. The special committee is composed of Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm and Linda Johnson Rice. The Company has separately retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati as its legal counsel in this matter. The special committee has the full power and authority of the Board of Directors to take any and all actions on behalf of the Board of Directors as it deems necessary to evaluate and negotiate a potential Going Private Transaction and alternatives to any transaction proposed by Mr. Musk. The special committee expects to provide a further update concerning the process associated with Mr. Musk's proposal as soon as practicable.
