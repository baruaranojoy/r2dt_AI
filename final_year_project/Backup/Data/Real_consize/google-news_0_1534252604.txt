Content :Former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman during an interview on the "Today" show on NBC on Monday. In a morning tweet, Trump praised his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, for firing Manigault Newman last year. At a debate during the Republican presidential primary season, he was famously asked by moderator Megyn Kelly about his tendency to call women he doesn’t like “fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.” More recently, Trump has repeatedly referred to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) as “low IQ” and called CNN anchor Don Lemon “the dumbest man on television.” In her book, “Unhinged,” Manigault Newman claims the Trump campaign was aware of the existence of the tape from the “Apprentice” period. She describes a phone conversation about how to handle potential fallout with Lynne Patton, then an assistant to Eric Trump, a son of the president; then-Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson; and campaign communications director Jason Miller. On the tape, a person whom Manigault Newman identifies as Pierson is heard saying: “I’m trying to find out at least the context it was used in to help us figure out a way to spin it.” A person Manigault Newman says is Patton then describes having a conversation with Trump about the alleged tape: “I said, ‘Well, sir, can you think of anytime this might have happened?’ and he said, ‘No.’” In her book, Manigault Newman says she understands that Trump used the slur “multiple times throughout the show’s taping during off-camera outtakes, particularly during the first season of the Apprentice.” In tweets Monday, Trump attacked his former aide as “vicious, but not smart” and claimed that “people in the White House hated her.”
