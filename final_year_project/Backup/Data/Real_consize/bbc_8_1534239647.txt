He said the sacking overruled a decision by the head of FBI employee discipline, who determined that Mr Strzok should only face a demotion and a 60-day suspension. "The decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical Bureau practice, but also contradicts Director [Christopher] Wray's testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters," Mr Goelman said in a statement on Monday. A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok's personal views ever affected his work." Mr Trump took to Twitter on Monday to ask when the inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, which is being led by ex-FBI director Robert Mueller, will end. In another tweet, he called the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's email server, a "sham investigation," saying it "was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!" During the election, Mrs Clinton was investigated by the FBI over her use of a private email server to handle sensitive government documents during her time as secretary of state. In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr Strzok - a 21-year veteran of the FBI - asserted there was "no evidence of bias in my professional actions". Amid Republican criticism last year, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he was confident the special counsel team was being run "appropriately". FBI Director James Comey was fired by Mr Trump, who later said he had been thinking of the Russia inquiry when he made his decision.
