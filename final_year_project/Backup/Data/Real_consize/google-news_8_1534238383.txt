Content :Standing in front of soldiers and senior military leaders at Fort Drum in New York, Mr. Trump made no mention of Mr. McCain, 81, who has been one of the president’s fiercest critics but has largely been absent from the Senate as he struggles with advanced brain cancer. The president studiously avoided reading the official name of the legislation — which would have meant mentioning Mr. McCain — during the 28-minute speech or during the signing ceremony afterward. (The spending measure is officially called the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.) The president has repeatedly disparaged Mr. McCain, usually without using his name, even in the months since the senator has largely retreated from the Washington scene to his Arizona home for cancer treatment. At a June rally, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. McCain for voting against a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that “one senator decided to put the thumb down, late in the morning. The president mocked him the same way during a speech to conservatives in February, prompting loud and angry boos from the audience at the reference to Mr. McCain. As a candidate, Mr. Trump said he did not like Mr. McCain because the senator, a Navy pilot during the war in Vietnam, was shot down and captured, held for more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison and repeatedly tortured. More recently, Mr. McCain issued a statement critical of Mr. Trump’s Helsinki summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. McCain was one of the most important voices in passing the vast military spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Monday.
