Content :Royal Mail has been fined a record £50m by the UK communications regulator for breaching competition law. Ofcom said the company had abused its dominant position by discriminating against wholesale customers such as Whistl, which sought to deliver bulk mail. At the time, Whistl was expanding its business to compete directly with Royal Mail by delivering business letters in parts of the UK. Ofcom said Royal Mail’s price increases meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas, where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Whistl therefore suspended plans to extend its delivery services to new areas. Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom’s competition director, said: “Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. Royal Mail’s behaviour was unacceptable and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition.” Royal Mail said it was very disappointed by Ofcom’s decision and strongly rejected any suggestion that it broke competition law, adding that that the decision was “without merit and fundamentally flawed”. It argued that the 2014 price change was never implemented or paid, adding that it had been “robustly stress tested by Royal Mail under competition law and the relevant regulatory framework”. It was designed to protect its service from “cherry picking” letter delivery and the general decline in mail volumes.
