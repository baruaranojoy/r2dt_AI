Content :Mike Ashley is hoping to keep 47 of 59 House of Fraser stores open, partly by turning over floors of larger shops to Sports Direct or his Flannels chain, it has emerged. The Sports Direct owner, who is in discussions with landlords about new rent deals, said he wanted to retain 80% of House of Fraser’s stores and bring in “cool brands of the moment”. New Look : The fashion chain obtained a CVA in March to cut rents and close 60 stores, with the loss of nearly 1,000 jobs. Carpetright : The retailer obtained a CVA in April to close 92 of its 409 UK stores in September with the loss of about 300 jobs. Homebase : The DIY chain is in talks with potential buyers and also thought to be considering a CVA after a botched takeover by Australia’s Bunnings. Ashley said that in stores such as the one in Birmingham, whole floors could be turned over to Sports Direct under his strategy for the business, which he bought out of administration for £90m on Friday. Sports Direct is already in talks with landlords, via the advisory services company CBRE, about rent agreements that could mean 12 closures – fewer than the 31 planned by House of Fraser’s previous owners. While Ashley, and Sports Direct’s “head of elevation” , Michael Murray, the fiance of his daughter Anna, are expected to cut tough deals with landlords in the coming weeks, suppliers are having a much rougher ride. Suppliers, which are thought to be owed more than £60m, had hoped Ashley would honour their debts in the interests of good relations in the future. The £90m paid by Ashley went towards paying House of Fraser’s bondholders and banks, with other creditors not expected to receive more than 3p in the pound from administrators.
