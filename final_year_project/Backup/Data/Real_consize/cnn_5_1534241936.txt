Content :The two candidates who have received the most national attention are firefighter union president Mahlon Mitchell and former state Rep. Kelda Roys. Trump finished less than two percentage points behind Hillary Clinton there in 2016, raising fears from the left that with a comeback by former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty, the state could soon be ruled exclusively by Republicans for the first time in a half-century and face the same sorts of policies, like the union-busting stripping of collective bargaining for public employees, that Walker enacted next door. The leading Democratic candidates are Rep. Tim Walz, Attorney General Lori Swanson and state Rep. Erin Murphy. Baldwin has held a clear lead in recent public polls, but Republicans have long believed that the Walker-built political machine and the state's rightward drift could make her a surprisingly ripe target in November. Retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan's 1st District seat in Wisconsin is one Democrats believe could be competitive this fall. The primary there pits ironworker Randy "Iron Stache" Bryce against teacher Cathy Myers in what's been a bitter contest locally. The two states will join Ohio, Michigan and Illinois on the list of Midwestern battlegrounds with governor's offices on the ballot this fall that Democrats believe they can win. Walker, who frustrated Democrats in 2010, rolled back union rights in 2011, survived a 2012 recall election, and won again in 2014, looks vulnerable this year. And the progressive candidate's victory in a state Supreme Court election earlier this year buoyed the left's hopes there.
