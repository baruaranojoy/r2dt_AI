Sisters Siti Atikah binti ABD Razak, 19, and Siti Nadhirah binti ABD Razak, 21, were visiting from Malaysia when they planned to visit Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. Earlier in the week they had heard about a shooting in Manchester, northern England, but said that despite the incidents they had no plans to cut short their trip to the UK. Security measures in the area were reinforced after the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017. Four people were killed in that incident when a 52-year-old British man, Khalid Masood, rammed a rental car onto the sidewalk on Westminster Bridge. The man's car collided with several cyclists and pedestrians, before crashing into the barrier, shortly after 7:30 a.m., police said. London Ambulance Service said the two people treated for injuries were not believed to be in a serious condition. CNN's Gianluca Mezzofiore and Sarah Tilotta contributed to this report from London.
