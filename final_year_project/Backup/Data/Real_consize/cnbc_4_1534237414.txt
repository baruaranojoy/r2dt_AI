Content :The outlook for Hong Kong's economy is darkening as rising interest rates are set to slam the city's property market, while the escalating China-U.S. trade war also poses a danger. Growth is already slowing and economists are forecasting further weakness, with some projecting expansion in gross domestic product to nearly halve next year. Because of that, monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve is pressuring local rates and affecting borrowing costs in the city's notoriously expensive property sector. 'Adverse effects' "The biggest risk factor is the housing market from the tighter financial conditions," Nogimori said. Hong Kong's gross domestic product increased 3.5 percent in the second quarter from the same period last year, according to official figures released Friday. "The continued Fed rate hiking cycle and the escalation of U.S.-China trade protectionism will likely pose downside risks for the Hong Kong economy and financial market sentiment," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report. "Domestically, significant corrections in the property market will likely lead to adverse effects on household balance sheets and overall economic activity," the bank said. Consumer spending is holding up so far and Hong Kong continues to get a boost from visiting mainland tourists despite a weakening Chinese yuan, said Kelvin Lam, economist for Greater China at HSBC. "There are tentative signs that consumption of durable goods are slowing, suggesting that the gyration in asset markets and gradually rising mortgage payments might be starting to bite," Lam said in a report. "These include credit default events in China amid corporate deleveraging, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and an accelerated Fed hiking cycle," they said.
