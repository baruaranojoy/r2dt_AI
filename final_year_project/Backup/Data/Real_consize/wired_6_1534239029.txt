Content :Below, we’ll try to help you answer them by highlighting our favorite smart speakers for a number of special use cases no matter whether you prefer Amazon, Google, or if you want to know how Siri and Cortana stack up to the rest. It sets the bar in a number of areas, including sound quality, multi-room audio, and smart home compatibility. Plus, it's probably compatible with whatever ecosystem you prefer—it comes with Alexa enabled, but also supports Apple Airplay 2 and upcoming software improvements will add Google Assistant. Out of all of the smart speakers I’ve used, the sheer convenience and usability of the JBL Link 20 (( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ) have made it my favorite. It also has helpful indicator lights showing you how much battery is left and how strong your Wi-Fi signal is, both important when you’re moving a speaker around the house (or in the backyard). Pairing via Bluetooth is also easy and I like that you can charge it while it stands upright, something that requires an adapter on the rival UE Blast and Megablast speakers . Google Assistant can now play Netflix on your Chromecast devices, too so you can fire up your latest favorite show with a simple voice command. It has Alexa and Airplay support (with some Siri) out of the box and Google Assistant is coming, but the real benefit is how seamlessly it can connect with other Sonos speakers. It's a lot like Amazon's Echo Show, and basically just adds a small visual element to your voice searches, letting you use a touchscreen if you'd like. The Home Mini can tell you the weather, play white noise for you, answer your random questions, and has more contextual awareness than Alexa.
