William Shatner and Mark Hamill both have stars on the Walk of Fame
Star Trek actor William Shatner has joined Star Wars' Mark Hamill in calling for the late Carrie Fisher to be given a Hollywood Walk of Fame star. The actress - famed for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise - died in 2016. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce then decides whether to accept the nomination. Shatner tweeted his dismay that the actress's name isn't among the 2,600 immortalised on Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. Shatner later tweeted that he was in touch with Fisher's family to see what their thoughts were. The Walk of Fame Committee selects approximately 30 names for new stars every year. Other stars who don't have one include Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Robert de Niro. Fans did, however, create a makeshift star to honour Fisher after she died.

The makeshift memorial became a focus following Fisher's death To be eligible, you have to have been famous for at least five years and have "professional" expertise in television, film, radio, live theatre or music. If the celebrity's application is accepted, whoever nominated them needs to pay $40,000 for the manufacturing, unveiling ceremony and upkeep, such as cleaning.
