Content :The Post reported that Sonneborn was compelled take a more active role in local politics after observing the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The deadly rally claimed the lives of three people, including an anti-racism protester named Heather Heyer . "I think what pushed me over the edge were the events in Charlottesville, [Virginia]," Sonneborn told The Post . In a recorded governor forum, Associated Press reported that Sonneborn said, "I think Vermonters should take me seriously because I have practical progressive ideas, and I happen to be 14, not the other way around. Sure, the teenager isn't legally permitted to drive yet but he can still run on a gubernatorial ticket in his state. In terms of youth engagement, a seemingly critical element of his campaign, Sonneborn wrote, “A major reason I decided to run was because I saw apathy from young people in my community. We need to encourage young people to get involved in politics, because today’s decisions are their tomorrow.” “No Vermonter or American should die because they cannot afford health insurance,” Sonneborn wrote. Environmentally, Sonneborn would back a carbon emissions tax and when it comes to the state’s education system, he said he would stand against filling the pockets of administrative bureaucrats and would support helping teachers instead. According to Associated Press, Sonneborn is more keen on political participation from young people.
