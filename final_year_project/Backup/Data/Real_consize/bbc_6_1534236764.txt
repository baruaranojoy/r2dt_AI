Content :Michael Drejka, 47, shot Markeis McGlockton after a fight broke out over a disabled parking space on 19 July. He was not immediately arrested due to the state's "stand your ground" law, which protects those claiming self-defence after a violent incident. Pinellas County State Attorney Bernie McCabe said his office "filed the charge we think we can prove", the Tampa Bay Times newspaper reported. Mr McGlockton's family said in a statement that the arrest was "a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning," US media reported. "While this decision cannot bring back our partner, our son, our father, we take solace in knowing our voices are being heard as we work for justice. "This man killed Markeis in cold blood, without a second thought about the devastating impact his actions would have on our family, but this charge gives us a measure of hope that the truth will win and justice will prevail in the end." "This self-appointed wannabe cop attempted to hide behind 'Stand Your Ground' to defend his indefensible actions, but the truth has finally cut through the noise," Mr Crump said.

Florida's "stand your ground" or "shoot first" law gives protection from criminal prosecution or civil liability to people who claim self-defence after a shooting or violent incident. In a statement on Monday, Mr Gualtieri said: "I support the State Attorney's decision and will have no further comment as the case continues to work its way through the criminal justice system." Footage of the shooting was recorded on CCTV outside the convenience store and shows Mr McGlockton rushing back inside the building while clutching his chest.
