Content :Ellis' permission to call back a financial fraud agent with the enforcement agency FinCEN to speak about Manafort's foreign banking charges. The witness, Paula Liss, testified that not only hadn't Manafort himself disclosed to the agency the existence of his foreign accounts, but neither did his consulting company, which brought in millions of dollars for Ukrainian lobbying. The Justice Department released emails from Calk to Manafort where the banker made his case for a Trump administration job -- including secretary of defense. The list of "Perspective Rolls (sic)," as Calk wrote, also included the top jobs at Treasury, Commerce and Housing and Urban Development. Also on the list: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Ireland, Australia, China, United Nations, NATO, European Union, Portugal, Holy See, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands and Singapore. Manafort's defense attorneys formally asked the court to dismiss the case, a type of request that typically happens at the end of a prosecution's presentation and is usually quickly set aside by the trial judge. He'd open himself up to cross-examination by the prosecutors, who've presented reams of evidence against him, and anything he says in court could be used against him in September, when his second criminal trial for foreign lobbying violations is set to begin. Prosecutors tied up the loose ends of their case on Monday, calling the last banker to testify and asking a financial fraud federal agent to return to the witness box. The bank knew and documented the financial red flags that came with Manafort's loan applications -- from hidden debt to shaky professional income. Calk sought a top role in the Trump campaign and administration at the time the bank approved the loans, another witness testified.
