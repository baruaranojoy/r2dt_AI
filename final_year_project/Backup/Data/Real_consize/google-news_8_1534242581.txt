One thing he did not do, however, was to mention the name of the bill: The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The bill was named for the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Trump nemesis who is battling brain cancer. "For those asking did I expect Trump to be an asshole today," former McCain speechwriter Mark Salter said on Twitter. McCain has been critical of Trump's stance toward Russia, and cast the deciding vote against a Trump-driven proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year. Trump referred to that episode later Monday at a campaign event in Utica, N.Y. "One of our wonderful senators said thumbs down at 2 o'clock in the morning," he said to a smattering of boos.
