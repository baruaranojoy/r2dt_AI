President Erdogan has accused the US of seeking to "stab [Turkey] in the back"
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said his country will boycott US electronic products, after Washington imposed punitive sanctions on Ankara. President Erdogan said Turkey was taking measures to stabilise the economy, and should not "give in to the enemy" by investing in foreign currencies. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who is visiting Ankara, branded the US sanctions an illegitimate policy at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr Erdogan has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, but insists the lira's plight is the result of a "campaign" led by foreign powers. Now it appears there may be a small respite for the flailing currency, which has gained slightly in value after days of dramatic falls. The country's finance minister - who is also Mr Erdogan's son-in-law - will seek to reassure around 1,000 international investors in a teleconference scheduled for Thursday. But the US insists Andrew Brunson, a long-time Turkish resident who ran the tiny Izmir Resurrection Church, is "a victim of unfair and unjust detention". Image copyrightAFP/Getty ImagesImage caption
US President Donald Trump has called pastor Andrew Brunson "an innocent man of faith"
An evangelical from North Carolina, he has been held in Turkey for nearly two years over alleged links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. The ruckus between Turkey and the US has impacted on other countries' currencies, including the Indian rupee, as investors fear the lira's wobbles could spread to developing nations. India's government urged people not to panic on Tuesday after the rupee slid to an all-time low against the dollar.
