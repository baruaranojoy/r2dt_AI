US President Donald Trump weighed in on Tuesday morning, calling the perpetrators crazy "animals." I turned around and I saw a silver car driving from the crossing -- very fast and close to the railings, maybe even on the pavement," Ochab said. Jackie Laidley from London, who works as a manager in the Cabinet office, told CNN she couldn't reach her workplace because of police cordons. Sisters Siti Atikah binti ABD Razak, 19, and Siti Nadhirah binti ABD Razak, 21, were visiting from Malaysia when they planned to visit Westminster Abbey on Tuesday. Earlier in the week they had heard about a shooting in Manchester, northern England, but said that despite the incidents they had no plans to cut short their trip to the UK. Four people were killed in that incident when a 52-year-old British man, Khalid Masood, rammed a rental car onto the sidewalk on Westminster Bridge. The man's car collided with several cyclists and pedestrians before crashing into the barrier shortly after 7:30 a.m., police said. The driver, a man in his late 20s, has been arrested on suspicion of terrorist offenses and remains in custody in a south London police station. It appears to have been a deliberate act on an iconic London building, and as such, was being treated as a terrorist incident, said Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu during a news briefing later Tuesday.
