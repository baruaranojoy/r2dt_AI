Erdogan maintained an assertive stance in a speech Tuesday and claimed he had been taking necessary measures to arrest the recent slide in Turkish assets. Speaking at a Symposium in Ankara, Erdogan said Turkish businesses must continue to produce and export the country's own goods. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey, April 17, 2017. Erdogan also namechecked Vestel Venus phones as a home-built alternative for Turks to buy, prompting shares in that company to rise almost 5 percent. Turkish stocks rebounded Tuesday after the country's struggling lira pulled back from record lows, sparking a Europe-wide relief rally. The latest estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show that the total amount of Turkish debt payable in other currencies is more than 50 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Investors have shown concern that the government is influencing the central bank, persuading it not to raise interest rates to a level that would slow rampant inflation. A sell-off in Turkish assets accelerated after President Donald Trump said Friday that he would increase tariffs on steel and aluminium originating from Turkey. The tariffs are a direct attack on Turkey's refusal to free jailed American pastor Andrew Brunson.
