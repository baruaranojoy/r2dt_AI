Content :A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after he crashed his car into security barriers outside the UK's Houses of Parliament. According to CCTV footage obtained by the BBC, the car mounted the pavement, drove against traffic, and crashed into a barrier outside parliament building. Images circulating on social media showed police arresting the man, dressed in jeans and a black puffer jacket, after officers swarmed on his vehicle and removed him at gunpoint. "At this stage, we are treating this as a terrorist incident," Neil Basu, the Metropolitan police's deputy assistant commissioner said, adding none of the injuries were believed to be life-threatening. Parliament was immediately placed on lockdown and surrounding streets in the central London district were cordoned off to the public. Eyewitness Ewalina Ochab told the Press Association the incident "looked intentional". US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged tough action against the "animals" behind the apparent attack. Euronews/NBC UK correspondent Vincent McAviney tweeted a video of police officers rushing to the scene. Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Millbank, a few hundred metres from the crash, said while it appeared the car was deliberately driven into the barriers, it wasn't a successful attack. The crash comes 17 months after Khalid Masood, born as Adrian Russell Elms, drove his vehicle at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a policeman on guard outside parliament.
