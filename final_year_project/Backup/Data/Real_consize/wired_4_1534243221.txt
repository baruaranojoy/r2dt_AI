Content :A pilot needs to fly by and drop a package to a human (feel free to add your own back story). Yes, that might have a small effect, but I will leave the investigation of air resistance as a homework problem for you (at the the end). Since the final position is zero and the initial velocity is zero m/s, I can use this to solve for the time of motion. Now let's make some approximations and put in values for the altitude and the starting velocity. The stall speed of a Piper Cub is about 38 mph so I will use a starting velocity that's a little bit faster—let's call it 20 m/s. The basic idea is to mark the location of the ball in each frame of the video to get position and time data. First, this is the trajectory (vertical vs. horizontal position) for both the plane and the ball (a short time after it was dropped). Since I am using the size of the basketball goal for the scale, this means the altitude will be off a little bit. Calculate the approximate acceleration of the ball due to air drag—approximations required. It would be fun to rerun with random starting values to see how often the ball "hits."
