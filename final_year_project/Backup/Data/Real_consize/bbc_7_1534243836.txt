Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, appeared in court in April
A man accused of a string of murders, rapes and burglaries in California as the so-called Golden State Killer has been charged with another murder. Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, has now been charged with 13 murders after his DNA was allegedly linked to the crimes. Investigators accused the suspect of killing a 16-year-old girl's father after he tried to intervene in a 1975 attempted kidnapping. Mr DeAngelo, a former police officer, is accused of murdering Claude Snelling, 45, in the backyard of his home in Visalia, California. Mr Snelling was shot and killed while trying to save his 16-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Hupp, from a man attempting to abduct her. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption

The murder was originally attributed to a man that police had nicknamed the Visalia Ransacker, who had been linked to more than 85 burglaries in Tulare County, California. "With this filing, we have officially linked the Visalia Ransacker to an individual known as the East Area Rapist and, tragically, the Golden State Killer," said Tim Ward, Tulare County district attorney. Mr DeAngelo is in a Sacramento County jail and is accused of several other rapes and murders throughout the state in the 1970s and 80s. He had been accused of killing 12 and raping 45 people between 1975 and 1986 before suddenly ending his crime spree. Each of the first degree murder counts carries a maximum sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.
