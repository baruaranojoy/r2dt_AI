The billionaire's hedge fund reduced its stake in Apple by 486,000 shares, or 77 percent, according to a required 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. The fund also decreased its position in Twitter by 901,400 shares, or 36 percent. Greenlight also cut its stake in Micron by 3.1 million shares, or 92 percent. Shares of all three technology names have soundly outperformed the market this year. Last month, Einhorn admitted his fund has dramatically underperformed his expectations. "Over the past three years, our results have been far worse than we could have imagined, and it's been a bull market to boot," Einhorn said in a letter to investors. The letter revealed Greenlight Capital lost 5.4 percent in the second quarter, bringing its year to date loss to 18.3 percent through the end of June. â€” CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting.
