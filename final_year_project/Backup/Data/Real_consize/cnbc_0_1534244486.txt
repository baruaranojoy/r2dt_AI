Content :Ahead of the Nvidia quarterly earnings on Thursday afternoon, options traders are predicting some unusual behavior. Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, told CNBC's " Trading Nation " on Monday what to expect. The stock is far outpacing the broader market, too; the S&P is only up 30 percent in the period. · Heading into earnings, the market is suggesting relatively little risk this quarter. The implied stock move is around 6 percent in either direction. · Such a move is a touch lower than the stock's performance during the last eight quarters, which is closer to 9 percent on earnings. · Notably, the actual volatility being priced in is one of the lower levels the options market has seen in the last two years. Wall Street analysts are expecting average earnings of $1.66 per share, according to FactSet estimates. The stock closed modestly higher on Monday, at $256.12 per share. Bottom line: Nvidia is far outpacing the rest of the semiconductor space this year, and the options market is pricing in little risk for the stock ahead of earnings.
