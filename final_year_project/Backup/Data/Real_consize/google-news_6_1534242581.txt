The school said it had no record of her graduating.CreditFLA News OnlineA Florida State House candidate admitted on Monday that she lied about having graduated from college, just days after she tried to refute the accusation by posting a photo posing with what appeared to be her diploma, according to news reports. The candidate, Melissa Howard, who is running in a Republican primary for the 73rd District in the State House of Representatives, apologized on Monday, but declined to drop out of the race, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported . “The picture of the diploma shows that Melissa Marie Fox received a Bachelor of Science in Marketing degree from Miami University on December 20, 1996. We have no such record of a degree,” the university’s general counsel said, in a statement that used Ms. Howard’s maiden name. “Miami University’s degree for marketing majors then, as it is now, was a Bachelor of Science in Business,” the statement said. Tommy Gregory, Ms. Howard’s primary opponent, said she should withdraw from the race ahead of the Aug. 28 contest. The western Florida district they are seeking to represent includes portions of Manatee and Sarasota Counties. Other prominent state Republicans have called for Ms. Howard to drop out of the race, including Jonathan Bruce, a former commissioner of Manatee County.
