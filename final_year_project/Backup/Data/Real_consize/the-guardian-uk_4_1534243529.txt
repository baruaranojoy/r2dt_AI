Homebase is to confirm a wave of store closures that will see at least 42 DIY outlets shut, putting about 1,500 jobs at risk. The retailer is closing the stores, nearly a fifth of the 250-store chain, via a company voluntary agreement (CVA), a controversial insolvency procedure used by struggling firms to shut underperforming shops. Restructuring experts at Alvarez & Marsal will carry out the CVA, which will require the support of landlords. The latest restructuring would come on top of a store closure programme the retailer has been carrying out since February. A total of 17 Homebase stores have been shut this year and the business has also axed 303 jobs at its head office in Milton Keynes. Homebase could see some resistance from landlords to the CVA, with the property industry expressing disdain for the procedure, saying it leaves them out-of-pocket. CVAs have been adopted by a host of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare. The Homebase store closures follow the sale of the business earlier this year by its former Australian owner Wesfarmers to Hilco, a retail turnaround specialist, for Â£1.

Wesfarmers is known for its Bunnings chain in Australia, and attempted to import the home improvement brand to the UK by converting a host of Homebase stores into the Bunnings format.
