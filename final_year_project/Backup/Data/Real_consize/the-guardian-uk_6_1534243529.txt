Content :A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after a car crashed into a number of cyclists and pedestrians before hitting security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament in London, police have said. Armed police swooped on the scene in marked cars moments after the silver Ford Fiesta collided with the barriers at about 7.40am on Tuesday, pointing their weapons at the vehicle before a driver emerged and was placed in handcuffs. The dramatic scenes have echoes of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017, which prompted the extension of steel and concrete security barriers around the Houses of Parliament. A witness, Ewalina Ochab, said: “I think it looked intentional – the car drove at speed and towards the barriers. Another witness, the local businessman Jason Williams, said he saw a large dark car traveling at about 40mph crash into the barriers outside parliament.

Melanie Spindler, a tourist from Germany, was in the area with her husband, and their two children. Sam Goodman, who works for the Labour party at parliament, was leaving the evacuated area. The length of Whitehall was completely shut off to traffic, with the cordon extended up to where the road meets Trafalgar Square. The home Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Huge thanks to our emergency services for their rapid reaction to incident in Westminster this morning. It is understood Theresa May, who is on holiday abroad, was informed of the incident at 8am and has been given regular updates by officials.
