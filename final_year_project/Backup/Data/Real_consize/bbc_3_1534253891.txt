The shattered bridge spanned a stream into which much of the rubble fell
A motorway bridge has collapsed near the northwestern Italian city of Genoa, sending vehicles plummeting up to 90m (295ft) to the ground and killing at least 22 people, Italian officials say. Video footage appears to show one of the towers holding up the suspension bridge collapsing in stormy weather. One image posted by the regional emergency services shows a truck perched at the end of the surviving bridge section immediately before the drop. "It was just after 11:30 when we saw lightning strike the bridge," eyewitness Pietro M all'Asa was quoted as saying by Italy's Ansa news agency. Traffic was queuing on the bridge at the time, an eyewitness told Italian public television. Cars and trucks were trapped in the rubble and nearby buildings damaged, according to an AFP photographer at the scene. Rescue workers are operating "en masse" at the scene, regional emergency services say. The Morandi Bridge, built in the 1960s, stands on the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and southern coast of France. Work to shore up the foundation of the bridge was being carried out at the time of the collapse but the structure was constantly monitored, the highway operator was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. The part of the city where the bridge is is densely inhabited, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
