Content :Sanitary bins, familiar for years in female loos, are poised to be introduced into male conveniences in an attempt to cut down on fatbergs in the capital’s sewers, if Greater London Assembly members have their way. About 4bn disposable nappies are used, and sales of unflushable incontinence products, for men as well as women, has gone up by 50% to more than 1bn a year as the population ages. And in most public loos and toilets in restaurants, bars or offices, men have nowhere to dispose of such items except down the pan. Vast fatberg blocks London sewage system – video “Public awareness around single-use plastics, in terms of disposable water bottles and coffee cups, is high. Launched in the public toilets – female – in busy Leicester Square, the new wet wipe offensive aims to get people to “bin it, not flush it”. Stephen Pattenden, waste network performance manager at Thames Water, said: “Many people don’t realise how wipes that get flushed can cause blockages and fatbergs in the sewers. Instead, they cling to the insides of the pipes and combine with fat and grease to form the fatbergs, which have become so common across London.” Tuesday’s report calls on the government to bring in new labelling rules for disposable products. Wet wipes, despite the havoc they cause in sewers, are frequently labelled as flushable, which confuses consumers. The report also calls for much more signage in public areas, informing people about the dangers of flushing wet wipes and other plastic-containing products.
