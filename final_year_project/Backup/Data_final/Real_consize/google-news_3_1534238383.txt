Content :AMALIA, N.M. â€” New details emerged Monday about the fate of one of the children found at a New Mexico desert compound raided by police 10 days ago. At the bond hearing for Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and four others, prosecutors presented a disturbing update about his son, 3-year-old Abdul Ghani, whose body was found buried on an apocalyptic-looking compound authorities raided last week. "Some of the children have stated these ritual were intended to cast out demonic spirits from Abdul Ghani's body. All five defendants knew about these rituals," said Taos County Prosecutor John Lovelace. In the filth, authorities found shell casings, gun manuals, broken childrens toys and books written in Arabic. Taos County Planning Department officials Rachel Romero, left, and Eric Montoya survey property conditions at a disheveled living compound at Amalia, N.M., on Tue., Aug. 7, 2018. Jason Badger says he told authorities back in April a missing boy was living on his property. Authorities insist they investigated but lacked evidence, and public defenders say prosecutors are overhyping the case. Prosecutors said that police recovered not only weapons but a CD on how to build an untraceable and a manual on combat training. However authorities have yet to elaborate on reports that the adults were training kids to become school shooters.
