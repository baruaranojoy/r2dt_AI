Content :Melbourne has been dislodged by Vienna for the first time at the top of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s global liveability index, strengthening the Austrian capital’s claim to being the world’s most pleasant city to live in. Vienna regularly tops a larger ranking of cities by quality of life compiled by the consulting firm Mercer. At the other end of the table, Damascus retained last place, followed by the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, and Lagos in Nigeria. “A long-running contender to the title, Vienna has succeeded in displacing Melbourne from the top spot due to increases in the Austrian capital’s stability category ratings.” Vienna and Melbourne scored maximum points in the healthcare, education and infrastructure categories. But while Melbourne extended its lead in the culture and environment component, that was outweighed by Vienna’s improved stability ranking. Osaka, Calgary and Sydney completed the top five in the survey, which the EIU says tends to favour medium-sized cities in wealthy countries, often with relatively low population densities. Vienna, once the capital of a large empire rather than today’s small Alpine republic, has yet to match its pre-first world war population of 2.1 million. Its many green spaces include lakes with popular beaches and vineyards with sweeping views of the capital. In addition to the generally improved security outlook for western Europe, Vienna benefited from its low crime rate, the survey’s editor, Roxana Slavcheva, said.
