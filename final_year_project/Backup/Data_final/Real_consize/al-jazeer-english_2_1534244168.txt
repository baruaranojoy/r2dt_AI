Content :Five years ago, Egypt witnessed one of the deadliest days for demonstrations in its modern history when security forces killed hundreds of supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi. The dramatic dispersal of the sit-in at Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya Square on August 14, 2013, saw soldiers and police shoot dead more than 800 protesters in a matter of hours. Since 2013, hundreds of protesters, including leaders of Morsi's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, have been convicted at mass trials. After massive protests calling for Morsi to step down, the military announced the removal of Egypt's first democratically elected president on July 3, 2013. The protests - staged in Tahrir Square one year after Morsi was sworn into office - called for early presidential elections, with demonstrators accusing the president of failing to fulfil his electoral promises.

As time passed, supporters of the military across the city grew frustrated with the defiant sit-ins and calls to disperse them came from both largely pro-military private and state-owned media outlets. The military-backed government, officially ordered the dispersal of Rabaa and al-Nahda on August 14, with armoured vehicles, bulldozers and hundreds of security forces moving in the early hours. After a year-long investigation, New York-based HRW documented the events that led to the mass killings, interviewing witnesses and reviewing video footage.
