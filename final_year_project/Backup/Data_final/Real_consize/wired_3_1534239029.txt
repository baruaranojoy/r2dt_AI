Content :First and foremost, buckle up, kids: According to director J.J. Abrams' Twitter feed, the Star Wars: Episode IX train has left the station. Talks between the companies are ongoing, with Turner apparently asking a sizable sum from Disney to bring the deal to an early end. Meanwhile, the existing deal with Netflix for new Disney movies—which covers Rogue One , Star Wars: The Last Jedi , and Solo —will sunset at the end of the year, according to the New York Times . The Real Deal: Also hidden in that NYT piece on the future of Disneyflix was some information about the live-action Star Wars show that’s being created for the streaming service. The first season will be written by Jon Favreau and run for 10 episodes, with the cost to make the entire thing pegged at around $100 million. It's likely the show will take a serial format, and Favreau told the paper that the "new streaming service affords a wonderful opportunity to tell stories that stretch over multiple chapters." The Real Deal: Fan site Making Star Wars posted an interesting rumor last week suggesting that Favreau's series will be about the fate of the planet Mandalore after the fall of the Empire. (The series being set three years after Return of the Jedi is an old rumor that has been around so long it's now assumed to be fact; Lucasfilm and Disney, of course, have been playing it cool this entire time with regards to that piece of information.) The Real Deal: Film Threat put out a new "Franchise Forecast" video that offers up a genuinely plausible theory about Rey's parents, suggesting they weren’t quite the nobodies Kylo Ren said they were in The Last Jedi . If it weren’t for Kylo Ren's whole "your parents were nobodies" deal in The Last Jedi and how emphatically that was sold by everyone involved in the movie, it’s a theory that would make so much sense that it would almost seem ridiculous to come up with any other solution.
