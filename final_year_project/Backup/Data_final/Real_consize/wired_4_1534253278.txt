Content :After knocking them unconscious for a few minutes with carbon dioxide, the scientists paint the bright-red faces of Habronattus pyrrithrix black with liquid eyeliner, or stick false eyelashes to the heads of Maevia inclemens with Elmer’s glue. “If we give them a really good diet, their faces become brighter,” says Lisa Taylor, a behavioral ecologist who runs the lab. To figure out whether they were noticing, the researchers presented female spiders with male suitors who were either bare-faced or painted over with black liquid eyeliner (Urban Decay, if you must know). The data is still trickling in, but Taylor is finding that female spiders are indeed less likely to attack males with red faces versus their face-painted peers. “One is like, I have to tell you how good I am, and the other one is, OK, I'm going to do all these things so you don't eat me,” says UC Berkeley behavioral ecologist Damian Elias, who also studies jumping spiders. Taylor’s lab is also working with Maevia inclemens , a species of jumping spider whose males wear little crowns, known as tufts. Not, like, a whole eyeful of lashes—that'd be bigger than the spider—but the individual clumps of synthetic lash sold by companies like Ardell, cut down to the right size with dissection scissors. To test the female’s reaction to black and white, the lab outfitted termites with tiny striped capes. “But you would think if something gets a female's attention, it would also elicit more attacks, and that doesn't happen.” In black-and-white-striped males, then, the patterning may work as an attention-grabbing device that stops short of garnering too much attention—i.e., cannibalism. “It's in a female's benefit to discriminate those kinds of lies,” says University of New South Wales evolutionary biologist Michael Kasumovic, who also studies jumping spiders.
