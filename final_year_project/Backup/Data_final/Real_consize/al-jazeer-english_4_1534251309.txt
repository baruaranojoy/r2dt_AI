Content :Almost 2.2 million migrants are based in South Korea but it was the April arrival of people from war-torn Yemen on Jeju that sparked online outcry and protests on the island, as well as the capital, Seoul. Her views are based on what she has heard from other people, read online and seen on TV, and according to analysts, hers is a similar case to many Koreans who - due to the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the outside world - have turned up their voices against these Yemenis. There are also worries that the spread of false information is going by unnoticed and the government's apparent lack of involvement in the matter has failed to calm down the situation. Lawyer Il Lee reckons anti-refugee sentiment has been present in Korean society for a long time [Faras Ghani/Al Jazeera] On Saturday, around 100 anti-refugee campaigners hosted a fourth protest outside Seoul Station to demand from the government to deport all the "fake refugees" from Jeju and not accept any other asylum seekers. Most of the politicians in Korea have not talked on the issue while some of the civil bodies and relief organisations working for the Yemenis' cause have been threatened. More than 700,000 South Koreans filed an online petition urging the government to stop its visa-free policy for Yemen and send the "fake refugees" back home. In response, the government announced plans to tighten the country's Refugee Act, a move seen by critics as supportive to the protesters' demands. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Choo Mi-ae, chief of Korea's ruling party, admitted there was 'lack of understanding and room for improvement'. But despite the threats and sentiments, the majority of those helping the Yemenis in Jeju are Koreans - and in Seoul, many expressed hope that the government would take a stronger stance on the issue.
