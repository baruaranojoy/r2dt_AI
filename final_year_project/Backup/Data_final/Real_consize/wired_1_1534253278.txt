Content :Hovering above sports stadiums from Houston to Pyeongchang, many hundreds of them have lately sparkled in artful murmuration. Sure enough, a gang outside Denver sent a small fleet to harass FBI agents on a raid earlier this year. Take comfort, then, in this buzzkill: “The swarm is really an illusion,” says Mac Schwager, an assistant professor at Stanford who studies multi­robot systems. When drones “swarm,” on the other hand, they’ve been choreographed in advance, or else are being controlled by human minders with joysticks. In Schwager’s lab, small groups of five or 10 really can sync their movements, powered by so-called decentralized algorithms that tell each bot where its buddies are in space and time. But fully autonomous systems, Schwager says, are “sort of in the R&D phase.” More removed still are drones that can actively learn from one another and derive unprogrammed behaviors from their esoteric robo-chatter. The point of the short, which was screened late last year at a UN weapons convention in Geneva and has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times, is to scarify the notion of robots working together. Except that’s how teams of drones will one day be able to survey natural disasters, rescue survivors, clean up oceans, farm fields, explore other planets, and deliver your burritos. Nora Ayanian, a roboticist at USC, imagines a scenario in which every bot is programmed slightly differently, so that when they’re deployed en masse, the smartest among them teaches the pack how to act. Ayanian calls it “leveraging diversity in the control policy,” an engineer’s way of saying that more perspectives means better results.
