Content :And next year, already approved, we have $716 billion to give you the finest planes and ships and tanks and missiles anywhere on earth.” — President Trump, speaking to Army soldiers at Fort Drum, N.Y., on Monday Mr. Trump’s claim is wrong on two fronts: that the approved funding levels are “historic” and that the military “never” had money “for years and years.” It’s also not clear what he was referring to when he said the act “paves the way for 1,700.” Even if inflation is not taken into account, President Barack Obama signed a $726 billion National Defense Authorization Act for the 2011 fiscal year. Mr. Trump may have been referring to the sequester, in which Congress placed limits on military spending in 2011; they were effectively lifted in February. But his statement — that the Pentagon “never” received money during that time — is patently wrong. The United States’ military spending has consistently outstripped the rest of the world’s. In fact, it has been higher than the next seven to 11 countries combined since 2012, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. After the signing of the bill, Mr. Trump made several more inaccurate claims at a fund-raiser in Utica, N.Y.
