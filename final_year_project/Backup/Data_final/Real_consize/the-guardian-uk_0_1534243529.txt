Content :A Hong Kong pro-independence activist has decried Beijing’s rule over the city as modern-day colonialism in a speech to a foreign journalists’ association that defied China’s demand that the event be cancelled. Beijing swiftly criticised the talk, saying freedom of speech in Hong Kong did not extend to discussion of independence , which it said was a threat to national security. The government’s demand raised questions about Beijing’s growing influence in the former British colony, which was promised semi-autonomy and freedom of speech as part of the 1997 handover. Current and former Hong Kong leaders have criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, whose party is facing a possible ban on national security grounds . Chan told the FCC audience: “Sadly, we are a nation that is quickly being annexed and destroyed by China . The Chinese government criticised the FCC for hosting Chan, comparing Hong Kong’s pro-independence advocates to Nazis in Germany and terrorists in the US. The 75-year-old FCC has previously hosted politicians and newsmakers, including pro-Beijing speakers, at its clubhouse in central Hong Kong. The perception that Beijing is reneging on its promise of semi-autonomy, and eroding Hong Kong’s free elections and freedom of speech, is helping nurture a generation of young activists calling for greater autonomy , if not outright independence. Huge pro-democracy protests erupted in 2014 in response to the decision by China’s ruling Communist party to retain the right to effectively pre-screen candidates for Hong Kong’s leadership. Hong Kong officials have dismissed the FCC’s argument that Chan’s appearance amounts to a free speech matter, with the territory’s former chief executive Leung Chun-ying equating the club staging the event with giving a platform to “criminals and terrorists”.
