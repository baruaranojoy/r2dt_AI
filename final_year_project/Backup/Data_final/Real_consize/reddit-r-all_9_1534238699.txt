Content :Other hopes for the four-day week are that it will "reorganize and create time to support teacher development and preparedness," create a school calendar that increases instructional time and is "clean, clear and concise making it less difficult for families to manage." “I realize this will be a significant change for our students, their families, and the communities we are so fortunate to serve, but our district can no longer be expected to do more with less financial resources,” the release continued. By not running school buses on the days with no classes, he said the district estimates to save around $700,000. School District 27J plans to tack on a couple hundred thousand more dollars by not paying for substitute teachers. While the school district plans on saving money, some parents will have to pay a little more for child care. Fiedler said the district offers child care services on the days kids won't be in school. It costs $30 a day which he admits isn't as great as the option parents currently have when their students are in class. Fiedler said the new schedule also gives them an extra hour each day to catch up on work, which is something they don't currently have. “We are 100% committed to providing our students with the necessary skills and competencies that will enable a future far beyond graduation. School District 27J serves 18,000 students in Brighton, Commerce City, Henderson, Thornton and Aurora.
