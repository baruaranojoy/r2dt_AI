Content :The incident began at American Fork Canyon, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, when the Utah County Sheriff's Office received calls about a domestic violence situation between Duane Youd and his wife on Sunday night, according to Payson Police Department spokeswoman Sgt. "They had been drinking and an argument broke out and he started hitting her and some witnesses called in to police to say a guy was hitting a woman," Sandoval said on Monday. Youd was arrested and was bailed out Monday morning between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m., Sandoval said. "He then evidently went to the airplane" after leaving his home, Sandoval said. Around 2:30 a.m., Payson authorities received a call that a plane had crashed into Youd's home. He flew for VanCon, a construction company that owned the plane. Youd's wife and her son were in the home at the time of the crash, but were able to escape Sandoval said. Slade Buhler told CNN affiliate KTVX-TV he heard the plane circling the neighborhood around 2:30 a.m. Monday. Public records obtained by CNN affiliate KSTU-TV showed Youd lived at the home where the plane crashed, and he and his wife had bought the home last year. Payson police confirmed there have been previous domestic violence incidents at the home, KSTU reported.
