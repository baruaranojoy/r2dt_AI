Content :In less than five months, the Trump administration has collected more than $1.4 billion in new revenue from steel and aluminum tariffs, according to a recent report prepared for members of Congress. The Congressional Research Service estimated that, between March 23 and July 16, the U.S. reaped $1.1 billion and $344.2 million from levies on foreign steel and aluminum, respectively. Those earnings are on the rise as trade negotiations with allies linger on and President Donald Trump moves to hike tariff rates on countries like Turkey. Trump has suggested the tariffs – originally unveiled as a national security provision – could have the added benefit of reducing the federal deficit, which rose to $77 billion in July , wider than the July 2017 budget deficit of $43 billion. And the Treasury's borrowing to fund government operations is set to top $1 trillion this year for the first time ever. "Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated," Trump tweeted on Aug. 5. Tariff payments are collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and go directly into the Treasury 's general coffers. That leaves tens of thousands of requests unanswered, and companies operating under uncertain conditions in the meantime. Metal Partners International, an Illinois-based rebar company, has swallowed price increases on steel of more than $3 million since May as it awaits the outcome of its exclusion request. "This is certainly a shock wave to us right now," Frank Bergren, owner of Metal Partners, tells CNBC.
