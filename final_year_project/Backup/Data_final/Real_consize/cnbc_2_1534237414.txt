Content :A number of people were injured when a car collided with security barriers outside London's parliament building on Tuesday and the driver was arrested, police said. "The male driver of the car was detained by officers at the scene. We will issue further info when we have it," London's police force said in a statement on Twitter. Footage on social media showed a handcuffed man being led away by heavily-armed police. "Someone driving towards parliament at speed, it wasn't a normal, it's not a minor like accident, it's not like a road traffic incident," witness Jason Williams told Sky News. Television images showed police pointing their guns at a vehicle which appeared to have entered a lane used for access to the parliament building before it stopped at a security barrier. In March 2017, Khalid Masood, 52, killed four people on nearby Westminster Bridge before he stabbed to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament. It was the first of five attacks on Britain last year which police blamed on terrorism. Britain is on its second highest threat level of "severe", meaning an attack by militants is considered highly likely. Last week, a Muslim convert admitted plotting to kill more than 100 people by driving a truck into pedestrians on London's Oxford Street, the capital's major shopping thoroughfare.
