"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean," Nicolás Maduro said in a televised address. Venezuela's economy is in freefall, with inflation rates estimated to reach a million percent this year - but the price of oil has barely changed. Local media report that a cup of coffee costs around 2.2 million bolivars (around $0.50 £0.39 at black market rates).

Mr Maduro said "direct subsidies" would still be given to citizens with state ID cards, if they registered their cars in a government census - but he did not make clear how the scheme would work. This means that when oil prices were high, a lot of money was flowing into the coffers of the Venezuelan government. When socialist President Hugo Chávez was in power, from February 1999 until his death in March 2013, he used some of that money to finance generous social programmes to reduce inequality and poverty. But when oil prices dropped sharply in 2014, the government was suddenly faced with a gaping hole in its finances and had to cut back on some of its most popular programmes. Hyperinflation has been driven up by the government's willingness to print extra money and its readiness to regularly increase the minimum wage in an effort to regain some of its popularity with Venezuela's poor.
