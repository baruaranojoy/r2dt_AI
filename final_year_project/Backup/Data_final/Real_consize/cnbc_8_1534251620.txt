Content :Home Depot on Tuesday reported second-quarter earnings and sales that far surpassed expectations, reaping the benefits of a warmer start to the summer. The home improvement retailer, which had a rocky spring season , also raised its outlook for revenue and same-store sales for the full year, saying the number of customer transactions jumped during the quarter, and shoppers were spending more at its stores. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters: Spring was chilly in much of the U.S., prompting many homeowners to push back their gardening and remodeling projects into summer. Home Depot sales have accelerated more broadly thanks to a strong housing market in the U.S. and economic tailwinds. In previous quarters, Home Depot was helped by homeowners in recovery mode making repairs after severe storms including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. The Atlanta-based retailer is focused on growing its professional homebuilder business and believes that by bolstering its delivery platform it will be able to take a larger share of the segment. "Not only did our seasonal business rebound from the first quarter, but our overall results exceeded our expectations," CEO Craig Menear said in a statement in advance of a 9 a.m. Home Depot shares have climbed roughly 25 percent from a year ago, bringing the retailer's market cap to $223.9 billion. By comparison, rival Lowe's market cap is $79.2 billion, and its stock has risen about 26 percent since this time last year.
