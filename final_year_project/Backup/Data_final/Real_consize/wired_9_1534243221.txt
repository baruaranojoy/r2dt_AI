Content :By stashing the wrong things in external storage, an app can expose an Android phone to a host of potential attacks, including secret installation of malware, shutting down legitimate apps, and even potentially gaining control of a smartphone’s camera or microphone. Developers everywhere should be more careful in the way they’re using external storage,” says Check Point head of threat prevention Orli Gan. That prevalence makes some sense in context; a developer’s ability to save what they want to external storage is a feature, not a bug. A hacker would first need to get someone to install an innocuous-looking app —a limiting factor, but not insurmountable—and get them to grant the routine “External Storage” permission. Once in place, the malicious download would then opportunistically monitor everything other apps on the device are holding in external storage. Google does offer guidelines to developers urging them not to put sensitive code on external storage. But not only did Check Point find that many apps don’t follow that advice, Google itself isn’t immune from man-in-the-disk. The researchers found that sloppy external storage usage by Google Translate, installed on more than 500 million devices, meant that they could compromise certain files required by the app, and crash it. "The issues they have outlined do not affect the Android operating system itself, but rather, third party code and applications on devices," said a Google spokesperson. The permissive nature of external storage dates back to when there wasn’t much room on actual devices, necessitating SD cards to make up the difference.
