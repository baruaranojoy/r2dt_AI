Content :The boy's remains were discovered after police rescued 11 malnourished children who were being held at the site. Defence lawyers have argued that the prosecution are treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something prosecutors deny. Police raided the compound, near Amalia, on 6 August as part of their search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. Prosecutors had argued that the five were dangerous and should not be granted bail, because they had trained the children to use weapons and carry out school shootings. They also said that the remains found at the site belonged to Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a "religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits", where Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran. Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said. However, Judge Sarah Backus said that while the information she had heard was "troubling", prosecutors had not proved that the defendants posed a threat to the wider community.

Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said the prosecution was using a double standard because the suspects are "black and Muslim". Officers who discovered the children said they looked "like Third World country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing". Authorities had raided the site after receiving a message from someone that read: "We are starving and need food and water."
