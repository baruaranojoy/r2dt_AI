Content :The problem affects anyone with an Android phone and iPhone users running Google Maps on their devices, according to the AP report, which researchers at Princeton University verified. The Google support page for managing and deleting your Location History says that once you turn it off, "the places you go are no longer stored. In fact, the setting sits right above the Location History option, suggesting at a glance that the two things are quite distinct. "Tracking people without their consent and without proper controls in place is creepy and wrong," wrote UC Berkeley graduate researcher K Shankar in a blog post that first alerted the AP to the problem. Beyond creepiness, though, Google's location-tracking may also violate the Federal Trade Commission's consumer protection statutes against deceptive privacy practices. In 2011, the agency famously settled with Facebook over the social media giant's inability to keep privacy promises to consumers. As part of that deal, Facebook agreed to a consent decree in which it promised to reform how it tracked and shared user data. That decree has been in the news lately, after the FTC opened a new investigation this spring into whether Facebook's data sharing with Cambridge Analytica violated its 2011 settlement. The FTC has more recently penalized Uber, Vizio, the phone maker Blu, and many others for misleading customers about how their data was collected, stored, and shared. Former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani noted in a tweet that Google's "confusing privacy dialogue" may merit a closer look from the agency.
