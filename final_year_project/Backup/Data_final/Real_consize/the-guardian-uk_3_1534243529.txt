Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey will boycott electronic products from the US, which has imposed sanctions and raised tariffs against Ankara in a dispute about the detention of an American evangelical pastor. The Turkish president said he had been taking necessary measures regarding the economy, amid a slide in the lira currency exacerbated by the dispute with Washington, but it was important to keep a firm political stance. Switching to foreign currency would mean giving in to the enemy, Erdoğan added. “We will boycott US electronic products,” he said. “If they have iPhone, the other side has Samsung. In our country there is Venus, Vestel [the Turkish smartphone brands].” In a defiant speech, Erdoğan warned the White House that those who waged “economic warfare” against Turkey would pay a price.
