Content :It barely disrupts the snow, but uphill the accumulated powder suddenly snaps and flows down the hill, devouring our brave test subject. In the most severe cases, tens of thousands of tons of snow accelerate from zero to 80 miles per hour in five seconds, obliterating pretty much everything but rock. But now, thanks in part to groundwork laid by the animators of Disney’s Frozen , researchers have simulated in awesome detail the moment a slab avalanche shears from a mountain. While our snowman doesn’t seem to make much of a fuss when it lands, its disturbance has in fact triggered a weak layer of snow hidden under the surface. This creates a temperature gradient that leads to the formation of an extremely porous layer of crystals—it’s made up of 80 percent air. Scientists already knew this is what causes a slab avalanche, but Philippe is the first to build a modeling system to simulate the collapse of the weak layer. To do it, he began with a system that Disney animators have used to model snow, called a material point method, a kind of physics simulator that factors in things like gravity and deformation. As you can see in the GIF above, the team cut into snowpack, exposing a cross section, which they stuck black tracking dots on. “A particle is just a position, a velocity,” says UCLA applied mathematician Joseph Teran, coauthor with Philippe on a new paper detailing the work. At the moment, researchers usually need to go out and sample snow to find that weak layer, giving them an idea of the likelihood of an avalanche in a particular area.
