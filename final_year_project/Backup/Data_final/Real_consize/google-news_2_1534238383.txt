Content :Premier Daniel Andrews was scarcely more subdued, with his media statement declaring the 2017 result "seventh heaven". Tell a Doreen or Point Cook resident, trapped on arterial feeder roads morning and night, that this city is as good as it gets. Or a resident of Rowville still waiting for a train, almost 50 years after a rail line to the suburb was first promised by a Victorian government. From our congested roads in new suburbs to a lack of train lines to much of outer Melbourne, to the many dysfunctional high-rise apartment towers we have allowed to be built. Pru Sanderson, a former high-ranking Victorian government bureaucrat now working for Arcadis, said Melbourne was held back by its lack of a high-functioning metropolitan rail system. On Tuesday morning, with The Economist â€™s results just out and Melbourne knocked off the top perch, ABC host and former Age journalist Virginia Trioli interviewed Canadian planner Brent Toderian. We no longer have to, each year, hear politicians like Doyle or Tourism Minister John Eren "crow", as Toderian put it, about winning a largely meaningless title. In recent times, the Andrews government has started construction of a cross-city rail tunnel, for which it should rightfully be praised. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Matthew Guy is going one better, wanting to add a third toll road, the East West Link. Former state MP Phil Honeywood now runs the International Education Association of Australia and on Tuesday he said it would make marketing Melbourne to overseas students slightly more difficult.
