Content :Household appliances are offered for sale at Home Depot in Chicago, Illinois. Home Depot reaped the benefits of a warmer start to the summer, following a rocky spring season, and on Tuesday reported second-quarter earnings and sales that surpassed analysts' expectations. The home improvement retailer also raised its outlook for both revenue and same-store sales for the full year. Home Depot shares were up more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading on the news. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters: Home Depot's sales have accelerated more broadly thanks to a strong housing market in the U.S. and favorable economic tailwinds. Consumer spending on home improvement items hasn't fluctuated as much as it as on apparel, for example, in part because homeowners have been in recovery mode following severe weather over the past year. The Atlanta-based retailer is meanwhile focused on growing its Pro business and believes that by bolstering its delivery platform it will be able to take a larger share of the professional homebuilder market. Home Depot shares have climbed roughly 25 percent from a year ago, bringing the retailer's market cap to $223.9 billion. That's compared with Lowe's , which has a market cap of $79.2 billion, and its stock has risen about 26 percent since this time last year.
