Content :LONDON — A man crashed his car into security barriers outside Britain’s Houses of Parliament during Tuesday morning’s rush hour, injuring three people in what police are calling a terrorist incident. “Given that this appears to be a deliberate act, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident and the investigation is being led by officers from the Counter Terrorism Command,” said Assistant Police Commissioner Neil Basu. London Ambulance Service said its staff treated three people at the scene, two of whom ended up at a local hospital. In that attack, Masood leaped from his smashed car with a knife and began slashing at police and passersby. It hit a bollard,” Jason Williams, 45, told ITV news, referring to a traffic barrier on the sidewalk. Footage from a rooftop video camera showed the suspect’s car clipping cyclists and narrowly missing pedestrians, jumping a curb, weaving toward the barriers, before crashing outside the Parliament building, across the street from Westminster Abbey. Photographs taken at the scene show armed police surrounding a silver sedan, with automatic weapons pointed inside the car. Prime Minister Theresa May thanked the emergency services for their “immediate and courageous” response to the attack. In a WhatsApp message sent moments before the 2017 assault, Masood declared he was waging religious war on behalf of Muslim countries in the Middle East under attack by the West. After the assault, British police bolstered security around Parliament, erecting metal barriers to limit access to the buildings and protect the site from vehicles deployed as battering rams.
