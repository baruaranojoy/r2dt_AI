Content :A man has been arrested after his car crashed into security barriers outside the UK's Houses of Parliament and injured several people. London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement on Twitter a number of pedestrians were wounded but did not say if they suspected terrorism, calling it only a "collision". However, witnesses described the car as being driven at high speed before it hit the barriers. "The car drove at speed into the barriers outside the House of Lords," Ewelina Ochab told The Associated Press. The guards started screaming to people to move away." Images circulating on social media showed police holding the man, dressed in jeans and a black puffer jacket, after officers swarmed his vehicle with weapons drawn. Parliament was placed on lockdown and surrounding streets in the central London district were cordoned off to the public. Euronews/NBC UK correspondent Vincent McAviney tweeted a video of the incident as police officers rushed to the scene. Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Millbank, a few hundred metres from the crash, said while it appeared the car was deliberately driven into the barriers, it wasn't a successful attack. The crash comes 17 months after Khalid Masood, born as Adrian Russell Elms, drove his vehicle at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before fatally stabbing a policeman on guard outside parliament.
