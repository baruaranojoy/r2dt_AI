Content :Turkey's president fired a new salvo in the growing war of words with the United States on Tuesday, saying Ankara will boycott all American-made electronic products. Showing no signs of backing down in the standoff, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would stop procuring US-made iPhones and buy Korean Samsung or Turkish-made Vestel products instead. The lira pulled back on Tuesday from a record low hit a day earlier, helped by the central bank's new liquidity measures and news of a planned conference call in which the finance minister will seek to reassure investors. Analysts say the financial crisis has been a long time coming and reflects Turkey's refusal to raise interest rates to curb double-digit inflation and cool an overheated economy. "The one big thing that is in our favour, is that this these populists have put themselves up on a pedestal and now there is one person that can be pointed to, wether it's Erdogan, Maduro or Rouhani," he added. Soner Cagaptay, director of Turkish research programme at the Washington Institute, said the confrontation has now become between the leaders of the two countries, particularly over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson . Cagaptay said Washington had an "arsenal of economic sanctions" ready to deploy against Turkey, which he believed US President Donald Trump would escalate until Brunson is released. Traders said news that Finance Minister Berat Albayrak will hold a conference call with up to 1,000 investors to discuss the economy might also have helped support the currency. The two NATO allies have been at odds over several issues including, diverging interests in Syria , Ankara's plans to buy Russian defence systems and, most recently, Brunson's case. On Monday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton met Turkish ambassador Serdar Kilic at the White House to discuss relations.
