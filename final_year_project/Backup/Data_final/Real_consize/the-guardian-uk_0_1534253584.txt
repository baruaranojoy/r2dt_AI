Content :Street vendors in major Spanish cities have found themselves at the centre of an immigration row as rightwing political parties try to reverse their poll slump. Speaking in Algeciras in southern Spain on Monday, Ignacio Cosidó, the Popular party’s spokesman, sought to link manteros with crime in Barcelona . Last year there was rioting in the Lavapiés district of Madrid after a street vendor named Mame Mbayi died from a heart attack after allegedly being chased by police. The biggest concentration of manteros is in Barcelona, where during the summer months they flock to the beachfront district of La Barceloneta as well as the central Plaça de Catalunya. Legitimate businesses complain of unfair competition and Ortiz said that in the past year more than 1 million pirated artefacts had been confiscated, although the manteros insist the market for their fake Michael Kors handbags and Ray-Ban sunglasses is not the same as those who buy the real thing. Lamine Sarr, spokesman for the Manteros Union, who is from Senegal and has lived in Barcelona for 10 years, denies that it’s about public space. In the absence of a government amnesty, they are condemned to live forever on the margins, looking over their shoulders for the police who, overwhelmed by the scale of the problem, tend to vacillate between harassment and indifference. We need to address this from a human rights perspective, starting at the European level, because otherwise it’s hypocrisy to reduce it to a conflict over public space when it’s really much more complex.” Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours 525 migrants have been either rescued or come ashore in southern Spain , including a child attempting to paddle across the Strait of Gibraltar on a lilo. In due course, many of these people will become street vendors, scratching a living selling pirated copies of luxury goods to tourists.
