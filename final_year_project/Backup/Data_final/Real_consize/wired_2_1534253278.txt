Content :It’s a reliable metric for setting fitness goals that puts your cardiovascular health—ahem—at the heart of your workout. “It’s important to understand that there is a spectrum of what constitutes a normal heart rate,” says Dr. Gregory Marcus, Director of Clinical Research for the Department of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. This is because the heart muscle of a physically fit person doesn’t have to strain as much to support the body’s needs. So if your chest is pounding during a workout, your heart is pumping more oxygen-rich blood to support your physical exertion. Your heart rate can also vary depending on your level of stress, if you’re pregnant, or if you’ve just downed a cup of coffee. Dr. Marcus advises collaborating with a physician or a trainer to determine your target heart rate and the duration for which you should aim to maintain it during a workout. Depending on whether you’re easing back into a workout routine, or if you’ve been training regularly, you can set incremental goals to increase your progress toward your target heart rate. Wearables like Garmin, Fitbit, and Apple Watches have compatible apps that graph your heart rate over time. Make sure your wearable fits snugly around your wrist to ensure that it picks up your pulse during your workout. Some devices’ ability to pick up heart rates is compromised when you’re working out in the water, and others aren’t waterproof at all.
