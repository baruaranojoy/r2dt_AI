Content :Even at this unprecedented and mind-boggling scale, NewTV is a minnow, and TV as an industry has proved itself, in an era of disruption, to be surprisingly robust and resilient. We live in an era where Netflix is eating the world, where kids and grown-ups alike can disappear down a YouTube rabbit hole for hours on end, where the amount of time we spend watching video on our phones only ever goes up rather than down. In that world, it’s easy to extrapolate to a time where old-fashioned television is dead, killed off by a slew of younger, nimbler disruptors. But even Netflix is going to find it incredibly difficult to replace TV altogether, for the simple reason that there’s simply too much money there. But there are good reasons why TV’s central position in America’s households is much more deeply rooted than the would-be digital usurpers like to believe. As Alexis Madrigal notes , Americans still watch a dizzying quantity of linear TV, and they don’t seem remotely unhappy with it. But even if ratings decline, TV remains the only realistic way for companies, especially if they make consumer packaged goods, to showcase their brands in front of the people who do America’s shopping. People spend much less time reading physical newspapers and magazines than they used to, with the result that those ad dollars ended up migrating to exciting new digital platforms. To have a chance of being able to disrupt one of the most entrenched industries in America, NewTV isn’t just going to have to attract millions of viewers of its short-form content, it’s also going to have to persuade consumer-facing brand advertisers that it has an equally effective, but cheaper, alternative to the 30-second linear TV spot. That’s very unlikely, just because no one in digital video commands remotely the kind of ad-supported attention that TV companies sell for billions of dollars.
