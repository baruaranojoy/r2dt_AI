Content :British police arrested a man on suspicion of terrorism offences on Tuesday after he drove a car into security barriers outside parliament and injured at least two people. Police said a silver Ford Fiesta had collided with a number of cyclists and pedestrians before crashing into barriers outside the Houses of Parliament at 7:37 a.m. local time (2:37 a.m. "The driver of the car, a man in his late 20s, was arrested at the scene by armed officers," police said in a statement. Armed police swarmed the scene and cordoned off a large area around the parliament in central London, usually bustling with tourists and government workers. Witness Jason Williams said the car had struck a barrier on a lane used for access to the parliament building with force. Footage on social media showed a handcuffed man being led away by heavily armed police. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who like other lawmakers is on holiday during parliament's summer recess, said her thoughts were with the people injured in the incident. In March 2017, Khalid Masood, 52, killed four people on nearby Westminster Bridge before he stabbed to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament. Last week, a Muslim convert admitted plotting to kill more than 100 people by driving a truck into pedestrians on London's Oxford Street, the capital's major shopping thoroughfare. In October last year, 11 people were injured when a car collided with pedestrians near London's Natural History Museum, raising fears of an attack, but police later said the incident was a road traffic accident.
