Content :This is a purely performative kind of reaction I'm talking about: I don't add the "angry" face to Facebook posts from old high-school classmates, don't "heart" nearly as many tweets as maybe I should. Every tweet, every Instagram post, every Snap—they all peer out from our phones like those twins in The Shining saying "come play with us." Larry Rosen , a research psychologist at California State University, Dominguez Hills, is well aware of this pressure. The way he sees it, most of us, by virtue of using social media platforms, have submitted to their implicit obligations. Ever since Apple introduced reactions on iMessage in 2016, they've become increasingly commonplace in group text threads, even when they're completely superfluous. I was in a movie once and felt my pocket vibrate so frequently I was sure President Trump had been impeached or Beyoncé had dropped an album. Sure, I may need to lock down my notifications, but this feels suspiciously like the essence of "diminishing returns." Every tweet, every Instagram post, every Snap—they all peer out from our phones like those twins in The Shining saying 'come play with us.' Reactions on text threads and social media aren't that different from smiling or nodding while someone is talking. "They are niceties that express that we’re listening, signal interest, and keep the conversation going," says Paul Dourish, Chancellor's Professor of Informatics at UC Irvine.
