Mr Pohiva told a local newspaper he would propose the competition when the leaders meet next month. On some, up to 90% of the population are overweight, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The region's obesity epidemic has been blamed on traditional diets of fish and vegetables being shunned for processed food imports and fatty meat. Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
