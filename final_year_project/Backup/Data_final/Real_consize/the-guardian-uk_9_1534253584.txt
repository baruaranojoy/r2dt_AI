Content :A man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences after a car crashed into a number of cyclists and pedestrians before hitting security barriers outside the Houses of Parliament in London. Armed police swooped on the scene in marked cars moments after the silver Ford Fiesta collided with the barriers at about 7.40am on Tuesday. Speaking outside New Scotland Yard, Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing in the UK, said officers were working to get more information on the suspect but he was not cooperating. Map “Given that this appears to be a deliberate attack, the method and this being an iconic site, we are treating it as a terrorist incident,” said Basu. The dramatic scenes have echoes of the Westminster Bridge attack in March 2017, which prompted the extension of steel and concrete security barriers around the Houses of Parliament. The decision to treat the incident as terrorism was made for several reasons, including CCTV recovered by police showing the vehicle driving at pedestrians and civilians.

Streets around Parliament Square, Millbank and Victoria Tower Gardens were cordoned off. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “Huge thanks to our emergency services for their rapid reaction to incident in Westminster this morning. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, who has been embroiled in a row over his attendance at a ceremony where a wreath was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre, said: “My thoughts are with those hurt and injured outside parliament this morning in what is being treated as a terrorist incident. The US president, Donald Trump, tweeted: “Another terrorist attack in London … These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!”
