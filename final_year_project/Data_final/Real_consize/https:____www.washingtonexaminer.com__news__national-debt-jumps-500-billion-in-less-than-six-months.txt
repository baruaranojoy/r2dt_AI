Content :The U.S. national debt has increased by more than half a trillion dollars in less than six months, amid predictions that the U.S. is on the verge of returning to another explosion in government borrowing./*~*/The debt rose to an all-time high of $21.4 trillion on Thursday, according to government data posted Friday./*~*/That's more than $500 billion above the $20.88 trillion seen March 7, just a bit more than five months ago./*~*/While the debt continues to rise, the pace of growth has slowed for much of 2018./*~*/Growth of about $500 billion over the last five months is a relative improvement, one that reflects the surge of tax receipts that flowed into the government starting in April, when individual tax returns are due./*~*/The Treasury Department says the government is on track to have a total budget deficit of about $850 billion in the current fiscal year that ends Sept. 30./*~*/Fiscal 2019 is expected to be worse: The Congressional Budget Office predicts a budget deficit of just under $1 trillion./*~*/The budget deficit is just one factor in the total national debt, which also expands due to federal lending programs that aren't taken into account in the budget deficit figure./*~*/Under current law, the government is allowed to borrow as much as it wants through March 1, 2019, which is still more than six months away./*~*/Congress in recent years has avoided this limit by suspending the debt ceiling again./*~*/
