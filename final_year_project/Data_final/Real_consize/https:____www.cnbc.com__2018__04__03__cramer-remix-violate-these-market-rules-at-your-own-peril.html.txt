Content :VMware : CNBC's Jim Cramer expects an upside surprise from the cloud computing company, particularly after Cisco's strength this week./*~*/Splunk has partnered with Amazon Web Services and works with Coca-Cola, Nordstrom and the state of Alaska, among other other clients./*~*/That's why the "Mad Money" host has come up with a set of investing rules to help guide them through the emotion and the fallibility that can come with being involved in stocks./*~*/Plenty of Wall Street brokers and advisors prefer not to deal with partial orders or buying a stock gradually over time./*~*/In many ways, individual investors are often their own worst enemies, as Cramer has learned over the years./*~*/Yet no matter how much he repeats it, Cramer constantly sees sellers come out of the woodwork anytime an individual stock or the overall market takes a hit./*~*/Now, if you were an ancient hunter-gatherer and came across a grizzly bear, the instinct to panic and flee would come in handy, the "Mad Money" host said./*~*/Every morning at his old hedge fund, Cramer would spend a few hours going over the mistakes he made the day before./*~*/The problem is that so many investors act like Cramer's kids when it comes to the homework: they hate it, feel like it's punishment and don't understand why it's useful./*~*/"It may not be exciting, it may not be sexy, but this is the kind of routine maintenance stuff that protects you from monster losses down the line."/*~*/
