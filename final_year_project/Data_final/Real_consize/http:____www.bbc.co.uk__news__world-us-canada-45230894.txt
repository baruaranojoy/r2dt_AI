George Papadopoulos said he was told the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton
US special counsel Robert Mueller has recommended a prison sentence of up to six months for former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos./*~*/Mr Mueller, head of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, said such a sentence was "warranted and appropriate"./*~*/The memorandum adds that Mr Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with alleged Russian go-betweens./*~*/They included a London-based professor who said Russia had "dirt" on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton./*~*/"The defendant's lies undermined investigators' ability to challenge the professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States," the memorandum says./*~*/Mr Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - is one of three ex-Trump campaign officials who have admitted lying to investigators, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and businessman Richard Gates, who served as deputy campaign chairman./*~*/Separately, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort faces charges of bank and tax fraud in the first trial stemming from the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling./*~*/Prosecutors say the 69-year-old dodged taxes on millions of dollars he made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians./*~*/If found guilty on the fraud charges, Mr Manafort could spend the rest of his life in jail./*~*/The allegations against him are not linked to Mr Trump and centre on his consultancy work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine./*~*/
