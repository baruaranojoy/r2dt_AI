Content :Elon Musk suggested it could take Tesla "maybe" three years to come up with a low-cost version of a car, even as he admitted it was "really tough" to do given the auto sector's economics and competition./*~*/Amid recent turmoil surrounding Musk's stated goal to take Tesla private, the CEO sat for an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee to discuss the future of electric cars./*~*/Musk told Brownlee that Tesla was "really focused on making cars more affordable, which is really tough./*~*/In order to make cars more affordable, you need high volume and economies of scale," he said./*~*/When asked if Tesla could eventually make a cheaper vehicle with higher quality, Musk responded in the affirmative./*~*/He compared car making to the early years of the cellphone, which were bulky and lacked functionality./*~*/"With each successive design iteration, you can add more things, you can figure out better ways to produce it, so it gets better and cheaper," Musk said./*~*/With "natural progression of any new technology, it takes multiple versions and large volume to make it more affordable."/*~*/Musk boasted that Tesla shells out virtually nothing on advertising and endorsements, and relies heavily on word of mouth./*~*/That sent shares soaring, and ultimately prompted the SEC to open a probe, according to reports./*~*/
