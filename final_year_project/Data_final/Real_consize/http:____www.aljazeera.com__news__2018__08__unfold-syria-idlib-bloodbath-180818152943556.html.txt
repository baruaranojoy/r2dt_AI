Content :Just weeks after scoring a major military victory in the south, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad appears set to fully open a new, more complex, front in the country's war - now in its eighth year./*~*/Along with sharing a border with Turkey , Idlib is adjacent to Latakia province, a Syrian government stronghold that is home to the biggest military airbase of its major ally, Russia ./*~*/Still, several scenarios may unfold in Idlib, given the direct presence of Turkey which backs certain rebel groups in the area and operates as a guarantor power to ensure a "de-escalation zone" agreed upon with Assad's allies Russia and Iran at a meeting in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana./*~*/Amid the ferocious offensives, Russia brokered a string of surrender deals with the rebels, most of whom departed with their families for Idlib, dubbed a "dumping ground" for evacuees./*~*/The recent escalation and concerns over a ground push prompted the United Nations to warn this month of a potential "civilian bloodbath", saying that an offensive could uproot some 700,000 Syrians - far more than the number of those displaced in previous assaults./*~*/While the previous operations ended with negotiated transfers of fighters and their families to the north, an Idlib offensive will leave residents with an ultimatum; either to cross over to Turkey, if Ankara allows this, or to remain living under Assad's direct influence once again./*~*/Ankara also maintains its presence in Idlib in an effort to prevent ground attacks amid hopes to move tens of thousands of Syrian refugees it hosts back home./*~*/In May, just as it was trying to determine the province's fate through diplomatic talks and disarmament aimed at preventing a government assault, Turkey set up 12 observation posts along Idlib's border areas./*~*/By splitting from al-Qaeda in July 2016, HTS sought to reinvent itself as a nationalist armed group movement, hoping to gain international recognition for its more "moderate" stance, according to Ahmed Abazeid, an Istanbul-based Syrian researcher./*~*/He believes previous Russian-brokered deals between the government and rebel groups, which caused the forced displacement of civilians along with their fighters and their families, acted as "forms of submission" owing to Russia's military authority in Syria./*~*/
