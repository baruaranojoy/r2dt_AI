Content :Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a tweet earlier this week that the hotline for clergy sex abuse has been "lit up."/*~*/Since Tuesday afternoon, after a grand jury report was released detailing the abuse allegations, Shapiro said Wednesday that more than 150 calls and e-mails poured in./*~*/And since then, the office said Friday, "the hotline remains, live, active and is receiving calls."/*~*/Survivors "are now surfacing to tell their stories and seek justice."/*~*/Internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania show that more than 300 "predator priests" have been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 children, a grand jury report said./*~*/"Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all./*~*/Monsignors, auxiliary bishops, bishops, archbishops, cardinals have mostly been protected; many, including some named in this report, have been promoted."/*~*/The grand jury described the church's methods as "a playbook for concealing the truth" after FBI agents identified a series of practices they found in diocese files./*~*/The report investigates clergy sexual abuse dating to 1947 in the dioceses of Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton./*~*/Pennsylvania's two other dioceses, Philadelphia and Altoona-Johnstown, have been the subjects of earlier grand jury reports, which found similarly damaging information about clergy and bishops in those dioceses./*~*/
