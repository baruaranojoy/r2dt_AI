Content :The American auto industry is famously brutal to newcomers, and the idea of one succeeding with electric vehicles racked up the lolz./*~*/Under his leadership, the commercial space company defied entrenched aviation giants like Boeing by breaking into the rocket science business./*~*/As his side hustles, he wished a hyperloop industry into creation, dabbled in artificial intelligence, and won a contract to dig tunnels under Chicago ./*~*/Investors were used to this, but the company’s future hinged on the Model 3, a reality that evidently intensified the pressure, especially as the production process hit one snag after another./*~*/In the first half of 2018, he raged at the media, insulted financial analysts during a public call with investors, and attacked the National Transportation Safety Board —the Mr. Rogers of federal agencies./*~*/On Tuesday, he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private , and he had the necessary funding “secured.” The automaker’s stock price shot up, as did eyebrows at the Securities and Exchange Commission./*~*/“As a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements, as well as their market manipulation, Tesla securities purchasers were injured to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” one reads./*~*/His harsh reactions to negative press often beget more of the same, a surely unsettling shift from the years of mostly adoring coverage he received, of the publicly validated self-worth he must have come to expect./*~*/“But from a personal pain standpoint,” he said, “the worst is yet to come.” This bodes ill not just for his investors, but for everyone who thinks cars should be fun to drive and good for the planet, who wants to explore space, who believes in a better future./*~*/Elon Musk is Hercules remixed: not assigned his great labors as penance for his murdering his children in a fit of insanity, but driven mad by the effort of completing his labors—and now threatening to kill what he has created./*~*/
