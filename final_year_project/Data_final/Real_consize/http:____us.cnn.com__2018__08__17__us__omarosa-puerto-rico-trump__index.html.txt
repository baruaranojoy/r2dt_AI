Content :In the book, Manigault Newman says that it would not surprise her if Trump was taking out his ire with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz on the people of Puerto Rico./*~*/"I would not put it past Trump to punish the people of Puerto Rico to teach that woman of color a lesson," she wrote./*~*/"The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump," the President tweeted on September 30 from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was spending the weekend./*~*/Manigault Newman, who was fired by Kelly last December from her role as the White House Director of Communications for the Office of Public Liaison, also puts much of the blame for what she calls the administration's "lethargic" response directly on the chief of staff./*~*/Many Puerto Ricans were doing much of that work themselves, and as people grew more desperate and water became more scarce, I remember many reporters on the ground asking, "Where is the National Guard?/*~*/I saw local officials finally distributing FEMA-provided food for the first time more than a week after I arrived on the island, and not only did the meals mainly consist of sweets and ready-to-eat snack items, also described in Manigault Newman's book, there were often not enough to go around./*~*/The fact is, it took Trump two weeks to visit Puerto Rico, even as the images dominating the news showed shortages of electricity, water, food and gas./*~*/Once on the island, Trump indeed complained about the territory's fiscal problems, at one point saying, "I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget out of whack."/*~*/The result, the new book titled "Unhinged" alleges, was a slow and cavalier response to the devastation wrought, especially when compared to Trump's swift and effective handling of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida weeks earlier./*~*/Manigault Newman, a former senior White House adviser, wouldn't specify what offensive terms the Trump administration allegedly used when referring to Puerto Ricans, even when pressed to do so during one of her many interviews to promote her book./*~*/
