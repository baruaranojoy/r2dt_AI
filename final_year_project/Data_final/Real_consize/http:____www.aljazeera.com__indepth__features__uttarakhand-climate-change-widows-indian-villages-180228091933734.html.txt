Content :Two days before tragedy struck in Uttarakhand, the Meteorological Department had warned of heavy rainfall and flash floods./*~*/The state recorded more than 100 mm of rainfall in just two hours on July 1, leaving 48 people dead in the districts of Pithoragarh and Chamoli./*~*/Cloudbursts, landslides and floods are common, and large companies are often called in to manage evacuation and rescue efforts./*~*/According to disaster management officials, more than 800 people died in the state from 2010 to 2017 due to events triggered by heavy rainfall./*~*/But this death toll doesn’t include the flash floods of June 2013, which killed more than 5,700 people and wiped away entire villages./*~*/Piyoosh Rautela, who heads Uttarakhand’s disaster mitigation and management department, said the state is witnessing the fury of climate change./*~*/We are aware of the vulnerable zones and, we know, sooner or later, landslides will strike at these places," Rautela told Al Jazeera./*~*/Women suffer most in the aftermath of a disaster, and those from unprivileged castes face further exclusion with limited access to resources./*~*/We bring shame to the family," she told Al Jazeera, explaining that she rarely gets a good night’s sleep on account of her anxiety about the future./*~*/The struggling women, who say the state government had promised them jobs, are left to deal with the prospect of more unpredictable weather and an uncertain future./*~*/
