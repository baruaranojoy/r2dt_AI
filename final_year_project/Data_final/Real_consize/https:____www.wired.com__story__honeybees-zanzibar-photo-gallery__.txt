Content :Honeybees are industrious little creatures, schlepping pollen and nectar from flower to hive all day to feed their queen./*~*/But in the tropical archipelago of Zanzibar, roughly 30 miles east of Tanzania in the Indian Ocean, that's not all they do./*~*/Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous territory in Tanzania whose clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon trees made it a global trade hub for centuries./*~*/Negative effects of climate change, like droughts and flooding, threaten the economy./*~*/Well, bees pollinate trees—in particular, the fruit and spice trees that farmers are increasingly growing as a more climate-change resilient alternative to mono-crops./*~*/Their honey also provides beekeepers with additional income—as much as $10 per liter sold locally—that doesn't rely on cutting down timber./*~*/"We learned from Pembans that conservation and economic development are not mutually exclusive," Tritchler says./*~*/Another organization, Barefoot College Zanzibar , has empowered more than 40 women to become beekeepers, promoting parity in a society with traditional gender roles./*~*/Over the next couple of months, he followed the beekeepers around with his Canon 6D as they scrambled up trees to check their hives, carefully lowered them to the ground, and smoked the bees to sleep./*~*/The insects provide so much more than just honey—though the honey, which takes on the complex flavor of the mangrove, fruit, and spice trees, is delicious./*~*/
