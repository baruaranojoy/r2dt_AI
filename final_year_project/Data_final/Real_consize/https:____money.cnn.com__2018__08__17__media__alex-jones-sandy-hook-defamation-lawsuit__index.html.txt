Content :In a motion filed in a Texas state court on behalf of Neil Heslin, the plaintiff's lawyers said that Jones deleted Twitter posts, some of which dealt with the 2012 mass shooting, following a CNN investigation that found Jones in violation of the social media platform's rules./*~*/Heslin, who lost his six-year-old son in the Sandy Hook massacre, is a plaintiff in one of three separate defamation suits brought by victims' families against Jones, who has falsely claimed that the shooting was a hoax carried out by actors./*~*/Attorneys Mark Bankston, Kyle Farrar and William Ogden, who are representing other Sandy Hook family members in a separate suit against Jones, said in the motion Friday that they reached out to legal counsel for InfoWars, the conspiratorial website run by Jones, to "confirm whether these [news] reports are accurate and these items have indeed been destroyed."/*~*/"Despite counsel's silence, it is clear from Mr. Jones' own admissions that relevant evidence has been lost./*~*/As pressure mounted from pending defamation lawsuits and growing public indignation, Mr. Jones chose to destroy the evidence of his actual malice and defamatory conduct uncovered by [CNN]," the attorneys said in the motion./*~*/"At this stage, it is unknown exactly how much content has been deleted, though it includes extensive social media materials and reportedly hundreds of hours of video."/*~*/The attorneys for the plaintiff have requested "fees and costs to address the time spent on this matter," which could be as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars./*~*/Jones said on his program that he had his staff delete the tweets in order to "take the super high road."/*~*/His social media presence has disintegrated, after Apple removed the full library of his podcasts, YouTube terminated his account and Facebook unpublished his pages./*~*/And following CNN's investigation, Twitter admitted late last week that Jones was in violation of its rules but would remain on the platform./*~*/
