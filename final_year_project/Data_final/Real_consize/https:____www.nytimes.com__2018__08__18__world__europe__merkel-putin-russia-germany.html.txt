Putin of Russia is often boiled down to certain anecdotes: her put-downs about his role in the K.G.B., his attempts to rattle her by bringing his large black Labrador to a meeting, knowing her fear of dogs./*~*/But the two countries’ long history of alienation and rapprochement was also at play when Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin met for three and a half hours on Saturday at the German government’s villa in Meseberg, outside Berlin./*~*/Before the meeting began, they told reporters that bringing stability to eastern Ukraine and Syria and addressing the future of the Iran nuclear deal were the top issues on their agenda./*~*/When the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reached out to Moscow, partly to help the departing Soviet bloc countries integrate into the European Union, not only strengthening political and economic ties, but also investing in civil society./*~*/But a break in relations that started with the Russian authorities’ repressive reaction to public protests in 2011 and 2012 worsened in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported rebels in eastern Ukraine./*~*/Susan Stewart, a senior associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, cautioned that the leaders’ meeting in Germany should not be viewed as a fundamental shift in German-Russian relations./*~*/Russia had been surprised by Germany’s willingness to throw its full weight behind American sanctions on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the pro-Kremlin insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 ./*~*/“If you look at the image of Germany — and Merkel in particular — in Russian political discourse, you will see that it really has deteriorated tremendously,” said Sabine Fischer, head researcher on Eastern Europe at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs./*~*/He also addressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was at the heart of Mr. Trump’s claim, insisting that it was needed to “meet the European economy’s growing demand for energy resources.”/*~*/But Ms. Merkel has shown a willingness to draw a line, with her decisions to support sanctions against Russia in 2015 and to join the coordinated response to the poisoning in Britain this spring./*~*/
