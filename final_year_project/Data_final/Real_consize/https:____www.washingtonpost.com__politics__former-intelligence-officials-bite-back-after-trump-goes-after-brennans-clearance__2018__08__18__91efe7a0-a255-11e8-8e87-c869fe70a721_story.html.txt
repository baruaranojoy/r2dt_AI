Gabreski Airport in Westhampton, NY./*~*/August 18 at 1:15 PMThere are no safe spaces in President Trump’s America, and there is no better evidence of this today than the battle lines being drawn between the occupant of the White House and those who have led U.S. intelligence agencies in Republican and Democratic administrations dating back decades./*~*/The precipitating event was Trump’s decision to revoke Wednesday the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan — a loud, persistent and acerbic critic of the president./*~*/The order has generated a kind of collective rebuttal rarely, if ever, seen in relations between a commander in chief and those who have gathered the nation’s secrets./*~*/The reaction from those who have led in the intelligence community, displays a measure of alarm and represents a call for the president to return to norms, if that is now possible./*~*/That, however, would be a misreading of what’s involved here: an abuse of presidential power in the face of an American freely expressing his feelings about the nation’s leaders./*~*/On the same day that McRaven put out his statement, a dozen former intelligence leaders signed a letter condemning the president’s action./*~*/They included Clapper as well as two former CIA directors who have been regular critics of the president: retired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden and Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration./*~*/The signers disagreed on whether Brennan’s criticisms of the president were appropriate, in terms of his language, his harshness and whether he was crossing partisan lines./*~*/In an interview Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal, Trump connected his decision to pull Brennan’s clearance and possibly do the same for others to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Russians and Trump campaign associates./*~*/
