Content :The government is investigating fresh reports that a number of British Second World War wrecks in Asia have been plundered by grave robbers./*~*/The Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said he was “very concerned” to hear allegations that remains of four ships lying off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts have been looted./*~*/Altogether the wrecks are thought to be the final resting place for hundreds of Royal Navy sailors and civilians./*~*/Williams said the Government “absolutely condemns” the unauthorised disturbance of any wreck containing human remains./*~*/“I am very concerned to hear any allegations of incidents of Royal Navy wrecks being plundered in the Far East,” he said./*~*/HMS Tien Kwang, a submarine chaser, and HMS Kuala, an auxiliary patrol vessel, were carrying hundreds of evacuees when they were attacked by Japanese bombers near the Indonesian Riau Islands in February 1942./*~*/Earlier that month the SS Loch Ranza, a cargo ship, had been set on fire in a Japanese air raid off the Riau Islands and exploded, killing seven men./*~*/It came after HMS Banka, a minesweeper, sank after hitting a mine off the coast of Malaysia in December 1941, killing its crew of four British officers and 34 Malay sailors./*~*/Looters are said to favour targeting the Second World War-era wrecks because of the ship steel’s properties./*~*/In 2014, the ships, the last resting places of more than 830 Royal Navy sailors, were found to have been damaged by scavengers./*~*/
