Content :North Melbourne coach Brad Scott has no idea whether he can land the big fish he needs to reach the AFL's deep end./*~*/With North's finals chances dashed after Sunday's nine-point loss to Adelaide, Scott knows exactly what his club needs: a better midfield./*~*/Scott has tried to lure some top-line midfielders in recent seasons - namely Richmond's Dustin Martin and GWS' Josh Kelly - without success./*~*/The Kangaroos are again on the hunt amid speculation they're chasing West Coast's Andrew Gaff and Port Adelaide's Jared Polec./*~*/"We have been really consistent in saying it: we have people working behind the scenes on all of those things./*~*/"But we just think it's unfair to talk about players who are currently contracted at other clubs - and everyone is until the 31st of October."/*~*/Scott's Roos sit in 10th spot, a win behind eighth-placed Geelong and Port Adelaide in ninth./*~*/To sneak into the finals, North need both the Cats and Power to lose, and Scott's side must beat St Kilda and make up a 18 per cent on Geelong in the process./*~*/"And part of putting (captain) Jack Ziebell forward was to improve our competitiveness in our forward half but also to free up a spot for Jy Simpkin, Jed Anderson, Paul Ahern, to play in those (midfield) roles./*~*/"We need to keep improving that (midfield) part of the ground because we have got some offensive scoring power and we have got some good key defenders./*~*/
