Content :For the past 65 years, this event has continued to haunt the ties between Tehran and Washington - and in recent months has taken on a new significance amid a renewed diplomatic standoff between the two following US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions ./*~*/But if Mossadegh was in charge today, he would have engaged in direct talks with Trump, a former Iranian diplomat and current spokesman of the late leader's political party, National Front, told Al Jazeera./*~*/London sought help from Washington to carry out a plan to force the prime minister out of office, with the tacit approval of the Iranian monarch, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi ./*~*/On the day of the coup, Henderson, in a telegraph message to the CIA, requested "that five million dollars be immediately available" to support the newly hand-picked Iranian prime minister, General Fazlollah Zahedi, according to the same US document./*~*/Speaking from inside his northern Tehran residence full of memorabilia from his time as a diplomat, he described how student supporters of Mossadegh would write anti-Shah graffiti around the capital under the cover of darkness./*~*/On the day of Mossadegh's ouster, Bavand said, news spread that the then-prime minister was killed by the military plotters, sending a wave of anger and grief across the country./*~*/Marandi said Iranians can draw some lessons from the 1953 coup by resisting the current US pressure on the government - even though Trump has said he is willing to speak to Iran's leadership without preconditions, his comments were instantly walked back by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who listed several steep demands for such a summit to take place./*~*/Marandi pointed out that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had already "closed the door completely" on the possibility of talks with the Trump administration./*~*/Meanwhile, Sina Toossi, research associate at the Washington DC-based National Iranian-American Council, said that the main lesson the US can draw from the 1953 coup is that "intervention in the internal affairs of other countries can lead to unpredictable consequences and severe blowback"./*~*/"The effect was to radicalize the Iranian population in an anti-American direction, create fertile ground for the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic movement and the 1979 Revolution," he told Al Jazeera./*~*/
