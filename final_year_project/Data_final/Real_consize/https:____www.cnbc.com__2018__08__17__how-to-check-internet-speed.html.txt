Content :When you sign up for home internet, you often pay a certain price based on the speed of your connection./*~*/You might be surprised to find that you're not, in which case a call to your internet company may be in order./*~*/As streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have become more popular, and as resolutions have jumped from HD to 4K, so too has the importance of having a fast home internet connection./*~*/If you're streaming a show from Hulu and it's not coming down in high definition, or if it's constantly pausing, chances are you don't have a fast enough connection./*~*/If your home internet is capped at 5 Mbps, then technically only one device at a time is able to stream at that speed./*~*/To put that speed in perspective, it should allow you to download a 2 GB movie in a little more than five minutes./*~*/Now that you know why you want fast internet, it's time to make sure you're actually getting the sort of speeds that your provider promises./*~*/Unfortunately, since wireless data varies drastically on where you are when you test it, and how strong your signal is with a nearby tower, you can't really just call and have your modem reset as you would with home internet./*~*/Still, you can get a good idea of how your speed compares with your home internet, and where you get the best coverage./*~*/If you consistently see slow speeds at home, maybe it's time to find a new wireless provider./*~*/
