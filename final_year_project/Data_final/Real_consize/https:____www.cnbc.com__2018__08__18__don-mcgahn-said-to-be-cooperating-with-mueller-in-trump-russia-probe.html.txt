Content :The White House counsel has given the team investigating President Donald Trump 's ties to Russia detailed information about the president's conduct in the matter, The New York Times reported on Saturday , a fact Trump himself acknowledged was a bid for transparency./*~*/The publication, citing around a dozen current and former administration members, said that Donald McGahn has given Robert Mueller 's investigators extensive accounts related to whether Trump obstructed justice./*~*/The interviews have totaled 30 hours over the last nine months, and have been conducted in part with the president's encouragement, The Times reported./*~*/Trump and his advocates have vigorously denied collaborating with Russia's efforts to influence the election./*~*/In fact, McGahn's cooperation was the fruit of an initial decision by Trump's first legal team to collaborate fully with Mueller's probe, in the belief he did nothing wrong, The Times reported./*~*/On Saturday, the president said his team had voluntarily surrendered "over one million pages of documents" to investigators, and again lashed out at the probe./*~*/However, the publication cited people close to McGahn as perplexed by Trump's willingness to let the White House's top lawyer collaborate with Mueller./*~*/However, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has confessed that obstructing justice accusations – which largely center around the circumstances under which Trump's fired former FBI Director James Comey – made him nervous ./*~*/The former New York City mayor has stated that Mueller may be attempting to lure the president into a perjury charge./*~*/If you interpret his comment about firing Comey… as obstruction rather than removing a guy who was doing a bad job on the recommendation in part of [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein, then you see it as obstructing the investigation," " Giuliani told CNN back in May./*~*/
