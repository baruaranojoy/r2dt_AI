Content :The U.S. stock market could soon lay claim to being in the longest bull run in modern history, and it is more likely to power on than fizzle as it heads toward its golden years./*~*/For many strategists, the current bull market started its life after the wrenching trip to the bottom on March 9, 2009, one of the darkest moments of the financial crisis, when the S&P 500 touched 666./*~*/Those are two key factors for market gains, and they are in place at the same time the Federal Reserve removes some of the easing it instituted to create liquidity and encourage investors to buy riskier assets, such as stocks./*~*/They do say the Fed could tighten too much, the economy could slump or trade wars could intensify, chill demand and hurt earnings./*~*/That is a reliable recession warning, but analysts say the stock market has continued to rise until months after the curve inverts, in some cases./*~*/"The Fed, in my guess, is going to keep hiking until something in the financial markets breaks," said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief economist, Americas./*~*/LaVorgna said the Fed could create a tightening of financial conditions, then get concerned about it and pull back from raising rates./*~*/Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market can't be called the longest bull until it sets a new all-time high on or after Aug. 22./*~*/He said the market could be at risk from a policy error on the part of the Fed or a jump in oil or even a geopolitical event, like a new issue with North Korea./*~*/While the current bull market is distinguished by the fact that it has still not been truly embraced, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch monthly fund managers survey shows investors are the most bullish on U.S. stocks in three years./*~*/
