Alan Cowell Kofi Annan , the soft-spoken and patrician diplomat from Ghana who became the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, projecting himself and his organisation as the world's conscience and moral arbiter despite bloody debacles that stained his record as a peacekeeper, died on Saturday in Bern, Switzerland./*~*/Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, Annan was the first black African to head the United Nations, doing so for two successive five-year terms beginning in 1997 - a decade of turmoil that challenged that sprawling body and redefined its place in a changing world./*~*/On his watch as what the Nobel committee called Africa's foremost diplomat, al-Qaida struck New York and Washington, the United States invaded Iraq, and Western policymakers turned their sights from the Cold War to globalisation and the struggle with Islamic militancy./*~*/In 1998, Annan travelled to Baghdad to negotiate directly with Saddam Hussein over the status of UN weapons inspections, winning a temporary respite in the long battle of wills with the West but raising questions about his decision to shake hands - and even smoke cigars - with that dictator./*~*/In fact, Annan called the 2003 invasion of Iraq illegal and suffered an acute personal loss when a trusted and close associate, the Brazilian official Sergio Vieira de Mello, his representative in Baghdad, died in a suicide truck bombing in August 2003 that struck the UN office there, killing many civilians./*~*/While his admirers praised his courtly, charismatic and measured approach, Annan was hamstrung by the inherent flaw of his position as what many people called a "secular pope" - a figure of moral authority bereft of the means other than persuasion to enforce the high standards he articulated./*~*/"Annan felt that the very countries that had turned their backs on the Rwandans and Bosnians were the ones making him their scapegoat," Samantha Power, an author who became the US ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration, wrote in 2008./*~*/Despite the serial setbacks, Annan commanded the world stage with ease in his impeccably tailored suits, goatee and slight, graceful physique - attributes that made him and his second wife, Nane Lagergren, a global power couple./*~*/Kofi Atta Annan was born on April 8, 1938, in the city of Kumasi in what was then Gold Coast and which, in 1957, became Ghana, the first African state to achieve independence from British colonialism./*~*/She, too, was a scion of a prominent family, a niece of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who protected thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II but disappeared after being captured by Soviet forces./*~*/
