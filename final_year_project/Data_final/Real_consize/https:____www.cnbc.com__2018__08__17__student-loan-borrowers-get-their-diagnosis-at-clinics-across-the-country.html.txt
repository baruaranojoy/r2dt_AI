Content :When Lisa Mulhall raised her hand at the recent student debt clinic in Woodbury, New York, she had no idea that she was about to hear something that would change the rest of her life./*~*/The exchange occurred at one of the growing number of "student debt clinics," popping up around the country, everywhere from Louisiana to New Jersey./*~*/There are some 14 ways to repay your student loans, a web of forgiveness options and a soup of wonky terms like "forbearance" and "deferment."/*~*/At the recent debt clinic on New York's Long Island, attendees were asked who in the room had heard of an income-driven repayment plan – in which monthly payments are capped at a percentage of a borrower's income./*~*/In a recent survey of AFT members who are struggling financially, 80 percent of respondents said that their education debt was either "challenging" or "a major burden."/*~*/But the ones in Washington state have welcomed all college students, and the AFT is working to expand its reach by coordinating with local community groups./*~*/Meanwhile, one of the largest student loan servicers — Navient , is being sued by five states and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading borrowers./*~*/Kevin Pollitt, labor relations specialist at New York State United Teachers, led the student loan debt clinic./*~*/When he learned that his union, New York State United Teachers, an AFT affiliate, was looking for people to run these clinics, he raised his hand./*~*/At the end of the workshop, a few people came up to Pollitt and asked how they could bring more student debt clinics to Long Island./*~*/
