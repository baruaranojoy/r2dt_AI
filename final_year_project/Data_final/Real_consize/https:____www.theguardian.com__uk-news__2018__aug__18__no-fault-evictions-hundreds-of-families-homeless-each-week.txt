Content :Hundreds of families are being made homeless every week in “no-fault” evictions by landlords keen to cash in on rising property prices or put the rent up./*~*/These are known as no-fault evictions because landlords do not need a reason such as rent arrears or property damage to kick tenants out./*~*/The end of a private tenancy is now the single biggest cause of homelessness in England, with the number of cases more than trebling from 4,580 to 16,320 between 2009 and 2017./*~*/Private tenancies can also be ended when tenants breach their contracts, but the researchers found no correlation between these types of repossessions and the rise in homelessness./*~*/Photograph: Dinendra Haria/Rex/Shutterstock
Laura Johnstone, her husband and two sons are being evicted from their rented house in Wandsworth, south London./*~*/The family were made homeless last year when they were evicted from a squalid flat after complaining to the landlord and Lambeth council./*~*/“The ability of landlords to evict tenants without grounds allows them to cash in their assets and leave society to pick up the tab in the form of expensive temporary accommodation and misery for the people affected,” said Dan Wilson Craw, director of Generation Rent./*~*/“Councils have new responsibilities to prevent homelessness, and the government has just launched a strategy to end rough sleeping, but they have no chance of success if landlords can continue to kick out tenants with impunity,” he said./*~*/A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing said: “We have introduced new measures to stop so-called retaliatory evictions, but we know we need to do more and we are consulting on three-year minimum tenancies.”/*~*/Because of the shortage of council properties, many of the families who lose their homes in this way end up in temporary accommodation, which costs the taxpayer £845m a year./*~*/
