Content :The Port Stephens fire, which has ripped through almost 2000 hectares of bushland, is now being controlled by multiple crews, who will remain on scene and work through the night to protect 70 homes./*~*/Firefighters gained the upper hand over a fierce fire in Salt Ash, near Port Stephens, about 5pm, after strong westerly winds began to die down at dusk./*~*/Earlier today firefighters surrounded homes and warned residents to seek shelter as the out-of-control bushfire edges close to properties near Newcastle as it was too late to leave./*~*/NSW Rural Fire Service ground crews and waterbombing aircraft in Salt Ash battled the fierce blaze, which had already torn through more than 1700 hectares of bushland./*~*/Strong westerly winds fanning the flames and whipping up embers as the front moved towards houses near Rookes, Lemon Tree Passage and Brownes roads./*~*/Mr Notara said the strong winds were due to a low pressure system moving through the Tasman Sea following yesterday’s cold front./*~*/The Rural Fire Service has warned people south of Oyster Cove Rd, on Rookes Rd or Lemon Tree Passage Rd, to put their bushfire plans into action immediately./*~*/Three sheds were completely destroyed and the wooden bridge that carries the Bruxner Hwy over the Clarence River briefly caught alight but was extinguished before any structural damage was done./*~*/The blaze on the South Coast was downgraded from an emergency to “watch and act” in the afternoon after winds eased sufficiently for firefighters to track down and douse spotfires that cropped up ahead of the main fire-front./*~*/THINGS got pretty hot for everyone during the Salt Ash bushfire today — including a baby possum who made a dash from the burning bush for safety./*~*/
