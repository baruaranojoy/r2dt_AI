Content :World Vision New Zealand National Director Grant Bayldon has launched a public campaign to get the refugees to NZ./*~*/World Vision NZ national director Grant Bayldon said Australia's 'turn back the boats' policy has left these children in "harsh and basic" conditions, which had led to a sense of hoplessness./*~*/People detained on the island were experiencing severe mental health issues, with repeated suicidal attempts, and other life-threatening illnesses./*~*/On Monday, World Vision launched a campaign calling on Ardern to accept all the children detained on Nauru, and their families, into New Zealand, as a special one-off refugee intake./*~*/The rest remained in detention, and Bayldon said the majority of the families on Nauru had little hope of resettling in the US due to President Donald Trump's travel ban./*~*/Nauru and Australia had been reluctant to talk about this issue, but during the meeting no one would be able to escape the fact that those children were being held there, Bayldon said./*~*/"Really all it would take is a bit of creativity for New Zealand to go above and beyond it's normal, very small, refugee quota... there's no reason we can't settle all of these children and their families, either all at once or over a really short period."/*~*/Ardern's previous pushes to get Australia to accept New Zealand's offer of taking up to 150 of the refugees had caused some trans-Tasman tensions./*~*/Director of advocacy and campaigns for Australia's Asylum Seeker Resource Centre Jana Favero said on Friday afternoon, there were 119 children on Nauru, with varying numbers of family members./*~*/Meanwhile, 17 children and family members had been transferred to Australia via interlocutory injunction in individual court cases fought by Australian legal advocates./*~*/
