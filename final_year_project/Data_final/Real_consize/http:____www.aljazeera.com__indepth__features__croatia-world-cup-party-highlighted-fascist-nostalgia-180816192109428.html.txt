Content :The euphoric atmosphere turned sour for some as nationalist singer Marko Perkovic "Thompson" performed on stage during the parade in Zagreb, invited by Croatia's football team./*~*/The Ustasha were Croatian fascist nationalists who fought alongside Nazi Germany under the leadership of Ante Pavelic, who governed the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) from 1941 to 1945./*~*/Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish human rights organisation, has been warning about the rise of Croatia's "fascist nostalgia" for years./*~*/The centre regularly condemns the apparent acceptance of fascist ideology; in 2016 it blasted a plaque installed near the Jasenovac concentration camp with the "Ready for homeland!"/*~*/"It's not an accident that people show up at his concerts sporting Ustasha paraphernalia, symbols, uniforms, et cetera, and the text of many of the songs [speak about] nostalgia for Ustashe ... Jasenovac," he said./*~*/But for current Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, a media sensation who won over the hearts of football fans during the World Cup, there is no cause for concern regarding Thompson's performance./*~*/Special guests alongside Thompson included TV personality Velimir Bujanec, who has been photographed wearing a Nazi uniform with a swastika armband./*~*/In March, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre sent Grabar-Kitarovic a letter condemning her for whitewashing Ustasha war crimes as she met members of the Croatian diaspora in Argentina./*~*/The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance was "deeply concerned that hate speech, particularly that linked to nostalgia for the Ustasha regime, is mostly observed among young people", the report stated./*~*/"The driving force is no longer professional academics [as was the case during earlier revisionism under first Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in the 1990s], but popular quasi-historians and journalists who have rebranded themselves as researchers set up their own NGOs and appear frequently on TV," he told Al Jazeera./*~*/
