Content :It may have arrived at my home in a box delivered by FedEx, but from the moment I saw it, I wondered if the grill I was testing hadn't been shipped directly from the set of some 1960s sci-fi television series./*~*/I started with a whole chicken, cutting the bird in pieces, getting the internal temperature close to done in low heat in the indirect zone, then opening the lid and moving the parts directly over the hot coals just long enough to crisp up the skin./*~*/Then I fully opened the lower vents to increase the oxygen flow and really let the coals rip, allowing me to sear a bunch of asparagus./*~*/Combine the tubes with the firm-closing lid and I quickly learned how well they allowed me to control the heat, a quality on full display as I made my next dinner./*~*/Cut from the hard-working pectoral muscles of a cow, brisket is an all-day cook that tests (and exposes) any grill or smoker's strengths and weaknesses./*~*/My mom, having run into similar problems with my cooking adventures in the past had already begun rooting around in the fridge, preparing a sort of leftover smorgasbord for dinner./*~*/I pulled the brisket at 196 degrees, and packed it into cooler, a trick that Meathead suggests to do for two hours to "allow the internal temperature to even out and the collagens to continue to melt."/*~*/While I'm not usually the kind of guy who eats a day's worth of beef before the sun rises, the three of us got an early snack of some on the best food I've ever cooked./*~*/While I was able to cut a bone-in chicken breast in two with nary a wobble, that crosshatching was hard to clean and felt like a breeding ground for salmonella./*~*/Food writer Joe Ray ( @joe_diner ) is a Lowell Thomas Travel Journalist of The Year, a restaurant critic, and author of " Sea and Smoke " with chef Blaine Wetzel./*~*/
