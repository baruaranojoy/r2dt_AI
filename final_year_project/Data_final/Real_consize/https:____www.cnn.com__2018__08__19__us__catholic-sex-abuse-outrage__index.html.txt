Content :â€¢ Next week, the Pope plans to travel to Ireland, where the former president, in an interview with The Irish Times , recently accused a top Vatican official of pressuring her to "protect" incriminating church documents from civil authorities in 2003./*~*/The report also said some church leaders covered up the crimes, shuffling priests from rehab centers to parishes, giving no notice to parents or civil authorities./*~*/The details in the grand jury report are so disturbing -- one section describes a gang of pedophile priests who marked their child victims with crucifixes -- that some Catholics said they now fear raising their children in the church./*~*/Friday, Catholic theologians, scholars and lay leaders began circulating a petition urging all 271 active bishops in the United States to step down./*~*/"By finding almost no cases after 2002, the grand jury's conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse," Greg Burke, director of the Vatican's press office, said Thursday./*~*/McCarrick, who resigned from the College of Cardinals on July 28, apparently rose to the top of the church's ranks even though there were persistent rumors about his behavior with young men, including seminarians in his dioceses./*~*/Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, announced Thursday that he will ask the Vatican to conduct an "apostolic visitation," church-speak for an investigation, into McCarrick, and what church leaders knew about his behavior./*~*/In May, all of Chile's 31 active bishops were called to Rome for an emergency summit after a Vatican investigator looked into a clergy sex abuse scandal in that country./*~*/State Attorney General Josh Shapiro said his office's hotline and email accounts for abuse survivors have "lit up" with more than 150 calls since the grand jury report was published./*~*/Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, another key papal ally embroiled in the sex abuse crisis, has also canceled his appearance at next week's World Meeting of Families, a spokesman told CNN./*~*/
