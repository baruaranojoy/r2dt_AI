Content :Omarosa Manigault Newman does not just have tapes of conversations from her time as an adviser to Donald Trump, a person with direct knowledge of the records said on Friday./*~*/She also has a stash of video, emails, text messages and other documentation supporting the claims in her tell-all book about her time in the White House./*~*/Video clips, texts or email could follow, according to the person who described what Manigault Newman has called a multimedia “treasure trove”./*~*/She spoke hours after Trump’s campaign announced it was filing an arbitration action against her alleging she violated a signed agreement that prohibits her from disclosing confidential information./*~*/She told PBS this week: “I have a significant amount, in fact, a treasure trove, of multimedia backup for everything that’s not only in Unhinged, but everything that I assert about Donald Trump.”/*~*/Manigault Newman claims Trump officials offered her a job on the campaign as a way of silencing her, after she was fired from the White House./*~*/The White House has countered by branding Manigault Newman as a disgruntled former staffer with credibility issues who is trying to profit from a book based on false attacks against an individual she has called a mentor and has admired for more than a decade./*~*/Unhinged has spent the past few days at No2 on Amazon.com’s bestseller list, trailing only Rachel Hollis’ lifestyle book Girl, Wash Your Face./*~*/Manigault Newman was director of communications for a White House office that networks with various constituency groups until she was fired last December by chief of staff John Kelly, citing “significant integrity issues”./*~*/At a White House briefing this week, press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to guarantee that no such tape existed./*~*/
