Content :The cover-up allegedly destroyed evidence showing giant human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America./*~*/The pieces of evidence were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to “protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time” according to the court ruling./*~*/The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution./*~*/During the court case, new elements were brought to light as several Smithsonian whistleblowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology cannot admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churchward./*~*/A giant human femur uncovered in Ohio in 2011 by the American Association for Alternative Archeology, similar to the evidence presented in court/*~*/A turning point of the court case was when a 1.3-meter long human femur bone was shown as evidence in court of the existence of such giant human bones./*~*/«It is a terrible thing that is being done to the American people,» he wrote in the letter./*~*/The US Supreme Court has since forced the Smithsonian Institution to publicly release classified information about anything related to the “destruction of evidence pertaining to the mound builder culture” and to elements “relative to human skeletons of greater height than usual”, a ruling the AIAA is extremely enthused about./*~*/«Finally, after over a century of lies, the truth about our giant ancestors shall be revealed to the world» he acknowledges, visibly satisfied by the court ruling./*~*/The documents are scheduled to be released in 2020 and the operation will be coordinated by an independent scientific organization to assure political neutrality./*~*/
