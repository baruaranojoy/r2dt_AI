Content :The gigantic hominid specimen that measures an incredible 5.3 meters tall (17 foot and 4 inches) was discovered near the ancient ruins of the only megalithic civilization ever discovered in Australia, which makes the discovery twice as puzzling admits professor Hans Zimmer of the University of Adelaide./*~*/“The discovery of the Uluru archeological site last year already took us by surprise, but this new find is just jaw-dropping” he admits, visibly dumbfounded./*~*/Some experts have hypothesized that the specimen might have suffered from an extreme case of gigantism, a condition caused by the over-production of growth hormones, a theory professor Hans Zimmer dismisses as “pure speculation”./*~*/Until we have found more skeletal remains, we should not rush ourselves into hazardous explanations” he told local reporters./*~*/We cannot properly answer these questions at the present moment” admits John Thomas Buckler, head archeologist during the 2014 excavation./*~*/Some specialists believe a major catastrophe is the cause of the destruction of the Uluru civilization, turning the whole region from a rich fertile land into a sterile desert at the time/*~*/“Ferrous deposits are found all over the Australian desert, which possibly proves some sort of meteorite impact in the region” explains Sydney-based researcher, Allan DeGroot./*~*/“The analysis of geological deposits confirm a large impact in the region between 3,500 and 2,500 years ago” admits the leading expert./*~*/“The catastrophic destruction revealed by traces of vitrification and high levels of radiation at the ruins of the Uluru archeological site clearly lead us to believe both events are intimately linked together” he concludes./*~*/The radioactive qualities of the skeleton remains have made the scientists work extremely complicated, but Hans Zimmer’s team hopes international cooperation with other major universities could help solve the enigma of the giant remains much sooner by giving the team access to technologies that are not available in Australia for the moment./*~*/
