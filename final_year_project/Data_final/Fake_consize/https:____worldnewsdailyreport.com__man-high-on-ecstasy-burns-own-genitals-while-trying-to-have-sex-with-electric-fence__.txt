Content :Adam Weinberg, 26, was rescued by fellow partygoers of the illegally set up rave after they noticed he was in horrible agony and unable to unclamp himself from the electrified fence surrounding the area./*~*/The young man who was highly intoxicated on several drugs including ecstasy apparently mistook the electric fence for a sexual partner before feeling the burst of 220 volts and 13 amps passing through his body./*~*/I then did a shit load of Ecstasy and a bunch of amphetamines before taking a few hits of cocaine./*~*/Then someone poured some acid drops into my eyes and I totally lost it,” he told reporters./*~*/I felt like my balls were going to explode, that’s when I felt the horrible burning sensation and the smell of burning flesh,” he remembers before passing out./*~*/Although he has sustained second-degree and third-degree burns to his lower abdomen and genitals, as well as having one of his testicles removed, Dr. Hellen Murdoch of HonorHealth Medical Center says that with reconstructive surgery he should recover swiftly./*~*/Adam Weinberg says he hopes his story will reach other young adults and prevent further injuries or even deaths./*~*/“I realize now that I am a drug addict and that I could’ve died in the most stupid way ever,” he told the Scottsdale Herald./*~*/“But if my testimony can help just one person not to do the same thing I did, it will be worth the shame and ridicule this news coverage will bring upon me,” he concluded./*~*/HonorHealth Medical Center spokesman John Seymour admits the hospital has noted an increase in recreative drug-related health problems in recent years but has never heard of such a case before./*~*/
