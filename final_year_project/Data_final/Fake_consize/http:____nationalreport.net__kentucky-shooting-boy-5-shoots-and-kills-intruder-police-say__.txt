Content :<NationalReport>Authorities in Burkesville, KY, have confirmed the death of an intruder at the hands of a 5-year-old boy./*~*/Initial reports from the scene outline an intense struggle for the firearm before the child gained control of the weapon./*~*/According to police, the young whipper snapper fired just one shot from the .22-caliber rifle he received as a gift fatally wounding the intruder./*~*/Kentucky State Police said the intruder was shot just after 1 p.m. CDT Tuesday in
Cumberland County and was taken to a nearby hospital, where the victim was later
pronounced dead./*~*/Parents of the young man, certainly Parents of the Year candidates, gloated about their sons fortitude in the face of such events and praised his ability to stand up to Obama and his gun-grabbing Gestapo./*~*/This event underscores the importance of teaching young children marksmanship and proper gun responsibility./*~*/While liberals are sneaking around smoking hopeium and staging “events” to restrict our 2nd Amendment rights (think Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing), this courageous young man took destiny into his own hands and put down the deadly intruder with one clean shot (unfortunately the victim was the shooters 2-year-old sister)./*~*/National Reports Chase Logan is on the scene and will provide updates throughout the evening./*~*/Chase Logan is a graduate of Georgetown Law and current Washington insider./*~*/Chase works the Hill tirelessly in search of the next "Big Scoop" and has been the first to break some of the most salacious of DC stories from sexual indescretions to executive cover-ups./*~*/
