Content :In a sermon he delivered at the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by “Mahram relatives” (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law)./*~*/This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the country’s traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances./*~*/She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair confirmed his position yesterday, during a panel of discussion on the role of women in Islamic society./*~*/A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the country’s ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imam’s sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that “only men are worthy of going to Heaven”./*~*/The scholars said that many deviant groups and individuals over the centuries have been responsible for the spreading such false beliefs, which are not part of the teaching of Islam./*~*/Minister of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Call and Guidance, Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh told the al-Watan newspaper that Sheikh Al-Budair would be allowed to continue preaching, but will now be closely watched./*~*/The simple fact that the progressive Imam wasn’t arrested, suggests that some influential members of the Royal family may have secretly come to his defense./*~*/Rumors have already begun to spread, relayed by the Saudi media, that Princess Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan, the King’s second wife and mother of the Crown Prince Mohammed, could have used her influence to keep the religious leader from being arrested./*~*/The controversy has drawn reactions from various groups in the region, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who promised to kill the Imam if he doesn’t withdraw his declaration./*~*/She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair is expected to preach again at the Prophet’s Mosque next Friday, and his sermon promises to draw a lot of attention from both the media and the religious authorities./*~*/
