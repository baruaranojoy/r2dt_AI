Content :An investigation was opened by the FBI last month after 42-year old Darrell Johnson posted videos online where he presented his unique “vegan lion feed recipe”./*~*/In one of the videos, he bragged that he had been feeding the circus’ lions with his mixture for more than six months and that they were now “leaner and healthier than ever”./*~*/Investigators were finally able to identify and locate Mr. Johnson who is actually touring in Ohio with the circus, and veterinarians were dispatched to examine the animals under his care./*~*/Dr. Frederick Munster, who examined the five lions, says the animals suffer from “extremely severe malnutrition” and are badly underweight./*~*/The felines were transported to the Cincinnati Zoo where they will be taken care of until their condition improves./*~*/Dr. Munster, one of the veterinarians who examined the animals, says he’s never seen felines in such a bad shape in his 31-year career./*~*/He was released on bail only hours after his arrest, and immediately met reporters to denounce his arrest./*~*/He claims he’s the victim of a political conspiracy orchestrated by the meat lobby and that his lions are “perfectly healthy”./*~*/He intends to demonstrate during his trial that a vegan diet is perfectly healthy, even for carnivores./*~*/The first hearing for this case is scheduled for September 6 and is expected to draw a lot of attention./*~*/
