Content :George Hamilton, 56, was admitted at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital last week after suffering from severe constipation and vomiting what he describes as “big black turds” and “diarhea.”/*~*/Hamilton told doctors he had not been able to defecate for the past eighteen weeks and became increasingly worried when he started vomiting his own feces two weeks ago./*~*/Hamilton who works as a car salesman says his horrific bad breath made his work impossible./*~*/Doctors finally diagnosed him with gastrojejunocolic fistula, a rare disorder of the human gastrointestinal tract which forces the body into fecal vomiting./*~*/Fecal vomiting is often accompanied by an odor of feces on the breath and other gastrointestinal symptoms, explains Dr. Annette Edwards of the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital./*~*/“But I’m not gay, I’ve been married for 26 years” he told reporters, furious./*~*/Doctors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital have since then proceeded to manually extract 122 pounds of fecal matter from the 320-pound man, an 18-hour-long procedure according to medical staff./*~*/Hamilton will also undergo surgery next month to detach his colon from his stomach, a complication which may have arisen after a previous stomach surgery, believes Dr. Edwards./*~*/
