Content :Astonishingly, the papyri were written by men who participated in the building of the Great Pyramid, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, and mention the use of “beastly creatures” of “enormous size” according to Professor Al-Sammud./*~*/The outlandish claim would have been rapidly dismissed if it did not come from one of Egyptology’s most eminent figures and has definitely come as a surprise to the scientific community./*~*/Surprisingly, the discovery of the ancient papyri and 26 stone cosmetic palettes bearing carved decoration and hieroglyphic writings was made in a nearby cave only a few kilometers outside modern Cairo./*~*/The team of researchers believe that the caves had served as a kind of boat storage depot during the fourth dynasty of the Old Kingdom, about 4,600 years ago./*~*/“We unearthed entire rolls of papyrus, some a few feet long and still relatively intact, written in hieroglyphics as well as hieratic, the cursive script the ancient Egyptians used for everyday communication,” explains phD student Fatima Al-Faya./*~*/The most surprising portions of the ancient texts and stone palettes are concerning Ra Nt-Ka, translated as “God beast” which was presumably tamed and used to carry the large limestone blocks that compose the pyramids./*~*/“They are described as tamed beasts of burden who “eat of the Niles grass”, whose tail when lashed “can kill an army of men” and “whose necks reach out to the sky”, which lets us believe the creature could depict a species of brontosaurus of some kind” he adds./*~*/This incredible discovery occurs decades after paleontologists have unearthed the first fossils of a colossal new species of dinosaur in Egypt, one of the heaviest creatures to have walked the Earth./*~*/“We can’t speculate if this is the species of dinosaur that may have lived amongst ancient Egyptians but fossil remains are fairly prevalent in the Nile region and these amphibious beasts were definitely common in the area at one time” explains fellow Egyptologist, Helmut Ferrlug of the University of Berlin./*~*/One recent skeleton finding in 2014 proved to be a new species of Titanosaurus, a group of long-necked, long-tailed, plant-eating dinosaurs that includes some of the largest animals ever./*~*/
