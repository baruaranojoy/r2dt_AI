Content :Between June 2016 and March 2017, a total of 86 women who had paid 50,000 yuán ($7,700) to be inseminated with sperm from “candidates carefully selected from the Chinese elite” were instead fertilized with swine semen./*~*/A police investigation then led to the discovery of an unusual fraud involving the Rhinoceros Horn Fertility Clinic and six of its employees./*~*/They discovered that the clinic was purchasing pig semen from farmers in a nearby village and using it to fertilize its customers./*~*/During the investigation of the clinic’s dozens of refrigerated containers, the scientific police discovered over 80 samples of pig semen./*~*/Six employees of the clinic were arrested in March and all of them were found guilty yesterday by the Lanzhou state court./*~*/The director of the clinic, Mr. Wong Hu Chan, was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for his responsibility in the fraud./*~*/He admitted in his testimony that he had planned this unusual scheme in order to cope with the constant shortages of “high-quality semen”, which is hard to find in China./*~*/Mr. Wong Hu Chan, the director of the clinic, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the crimes./*~*/Fertility clinics are barely regulated in China and a handful of other disturbing incidents have occurred over the last few years./*~*/In that particular case, four women had died from infections linked to the mixture and the doctor who had performed the interventions was sentenced to death./*~*/
