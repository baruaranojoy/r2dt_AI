Content :The Oregon Herald reported Thursday that Mike Litte, 28, is seeking $500,000 in damages from the Apollo strip club./*~*/During the performance, one dancer apparently “squirted” on the dance pole, which Litte decided to lick before suffering from symptoms of syphilis days later./*~*/Candace Williams, an employee of the Apollo strip club, says she saw Litte in an intoxicated state jump onto the stage where he indulged in “French kissing” the dancing pole for several minutes./*~*/Andrew Smith, Mike Litte’s lawyer, believes the establishment’s lack of standards of hygiene is at fault here and that it was the dancer’s obligation to warn his client that she had an infectious disease./*~*/Mike Litte was also treated for symptoms of chlamydia and gonorrhea he also contracted that night./*~*/The owner of the strip club couldn’t be reached for comments but an employee reached by phone admitted that clients “licking the dance pole” was not a practice encouraged by the establishment./*~*/The lawsuit claims the Apollo strip club is liable for its employees and for maintaining minimal hygiene standards inside the establishment./*~*/
