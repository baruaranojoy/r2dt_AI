Content :The scientists, associated with the Department of Archaeology of the University of Sydney, were called to the site after some locals discovered what looked like the foundation of an ancient building in July, near Derby./*~*/The archaeologists, directed by Professor Allison Fletcher, were expecting a site from the early colonial period, but they rapidly realized that they were dealing with something completely different./*~*/The type of construction and the items found on the site are very similar to the various Viking colonies discovered in Greenland and Iceland./*~*/The scientists have also unearthed a total of sixteen tombs, including these warriors who were buried with their weapons and treasure./*~*/The archaeologists have discovered a large quantity and variety of artifacts on the site, including a few weapons and blacksmithing tools, some bronze and silver jewelry, four ivory combs, a few stone oil lamps, a dozen iron rivets and a bone knitting needle./*~*/Two broken pieces of porcelain, a bronze vessel and a jade ring from China were found in the tomb of one of the women, and some semi-precious stones from India and Sri Lanka were found in the tomb of one of the warriors./*~*/This large bronze vessel, found in the tomb if a Norse woman of high status, was manufactured in Southeastern China in the 9th or 10th Century./*~*/Professor Fletcher believes that the Norsemen could have chosen this site for its natural harbor, the availability of eucalyptus wood and the region’s abundant iron ore./*~*/It’s a long distance from the site of any known Viking settlement, expedition or raid, however, and it remains unclear how the Norsemen actually reached Australia./*~*/The Vikings are also known to have raided North Africa and some Mediterranean islands, but this is the first time that any trace of their presence is found in the Indian Ocean./*~*/
