Content :The specimens measuring between 47 and 61 centimeters are presumably from an entirely new species of humanoid, distinct from modern humans, which would have survived until the 12th or 13th century AD./*~*/The bones which were presumably partially unearthed by a recent rainfall, and were found by three local children who were playing in the area./*~*/The young boys immediately contacted the police, believing they had found the remains of murdered children./*~*/He contacted the University College Dublin to ask for help, and the institution sent Professor Edward James McInnes to analyze the discovery./*~*/The team of archaeologists led by Professor McInnes has named the species Homo minusculus , which means either ‘ Tiny Man’ or ‘ Is small in comparison’./*~*/Various small stone Tools and weapons were found near the bodies, including an axe, two knives, a spear point and even two miniature sewing needles./*~*/Many bones from various small animals including squirrels, hares, moles, and hedgehogs were found near the settlement, many of which bore traces of cooking./*~*/This amazing discovery suggests that many tales and stories from the Middle Ages which were considered as fantastic by historians could indeed be based on real facts./*~*/Homo minusculus could have inspired stories of leprechauns, elves, and brownies that are common in European folklore./*~*/Professor McInnes and his team believe that Homo minusculus could have disappeared due to the destruction of its habitat by surrounding human communities./*~*/
