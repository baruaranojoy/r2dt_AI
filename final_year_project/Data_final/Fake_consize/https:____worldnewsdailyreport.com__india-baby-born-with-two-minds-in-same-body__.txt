Content :Tamish and Rajiv Mukherjee were born at 09:10 AM at the Saiffe Hospital, after a long and complicated surgical operation meant to extract them safely from their mother’s womb./*~*/The boys are a unique case of diprosopus, a rare condition in which twins share the same body but have separate faces and brains./*~*/Doctor Parsa and his colleagues from Saiffe Hospital have made an extensive series of tests and scans on the newborn, before realizing that they were indeed dealing with two individuals./*~*/After realizing a complete medical examination of the twins over the last 24 hours, the team of medical specialist observed that the boys are in surprisingly good health considering their condition, with the heart seemingly irrigating both brains efficiently, an element of great concern for patients affected by diprosopus./*~*/A large crowd of onlookers gathered very rapidly around the hospital, as rumors had spread around the city that an “incarnation of Shiva” had just been born./*~*/The particularity of the twins seems to have struck a very sensitive chord with many Hindus, as duality is a core concept of the most practiced polytheist religion in the world./*~*/Journalists from all over India have joined in with the hundreds of pilgrims to try and meet the miraculous newborns, leading the police to use batons and pepper spray to push back the crowd./*~*/The boys’ father, Hakesh Mukherjee, seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention given to his family since the birth of the twins./*~*/An important question remains however concerning the capacity of the boys to eventually walk or speak since these basic actions would demand an exceptional coordination from both of them to execute./*~*/The twins have already demonstrated strange faculties, as one them can fall asleep while the other is awake, leaving one half of the body inert while the other is active./*~*/
