Content :An international rescue mission has been launched this morning in order to Irvin Walters, a retired trucker and notorious member of the Flat Earth Movement./*~*/Mr. Walters was last seen in the Australian port of Sydney on November 27, before he sailed South towards Antartica./*~*/Being convinced that Antarctica is only a thin ice wall surrounding a disk-shaped Earth, he hoped to cross it and take pictures at the end of the disk./*~*/Australian authorities have taken the American man’s disappearance very seriously and asked neighboring countries for help in finding him./*~*/A spokesman of the Australian Coast Guard says they fear he may have gotten lost or even capsized, and could rapidly die of hypothermia./*~*/They believe his ship has traveled at least 400 nautical miles south of Australia before it encountered problems, but they have very little information concerning his actual position./*~*/Mr. Walters has spent the last few months sailing the Pacific and the Indian Ocean aboard a small, specially designed boat, hoping to travel from California to Antartica./*~*/He said he hoped to gather some irrefutable scientific proof that the Earth is flat, like “pictures of the disk’s end”./*~*/He claimed to come from a family with a long naval tradition and described himself as a “7th generation sailor”, yet he admitted that he had never sailed before./*~*/Several analysts have speculated that this lack of sailing experience could have been a serious problem in treacherous waters south of Tasmania./*~*/
