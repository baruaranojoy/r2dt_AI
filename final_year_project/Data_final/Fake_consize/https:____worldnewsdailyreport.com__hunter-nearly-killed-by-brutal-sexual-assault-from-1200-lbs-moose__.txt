Content :Jeremy Larsen was hunting with his brother and his nephew near Dog Lake, in Ontario, when he accidentally spilled an entire jar of moose urine on himself./*~*/He decided to leave the group and head back to their cabin, three miles away, to change his clothes./*~*/Mr. Larsen tried to use his weapon to defend himself, but he was rapidly knocked out after receiving many kicks from the moose’s front hooves./*~*/While the poor man was lying on his knees, defenseless, the powerful animal began rubbing his massive genitals all over him, mimicking sexual intercourse./*~*/The severely injured hunter was found two hours later by his brother and nephew, who were also heading back to their cabin./*~*/John Larsen, the victim’s nephew, says his uncle was unconscious and covered in blood when they found him./*~*/Jeremy Larsen was transported by helicopter to a Toronto hospital, where doctors were able to stabilize his condition./*~*/He suffers from five broken ribs, a perforated lung, and 15 bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life./*~*/Only hours after the attack, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry issued a warning concerning the use of moose urine./*~*/The ministry states that this is the third attack of this kind to occur in the province since 2011 and that all three were due to urine spills./*~*/
