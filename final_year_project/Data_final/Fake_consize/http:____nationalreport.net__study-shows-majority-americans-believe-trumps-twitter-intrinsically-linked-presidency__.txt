Content :Donald Trump is infamous for his aggressive tweeting habits, which is why internet users were left utterly befuddled Thursday when @realdonaldtrump linked to a broken page on Twitter’s website./*~*/This absence was immediately noticed, and apparently gave many the false hope that Twitter was finally fed up with the 45th president’s late night flame wars with Hollywood liberals and had permanently banned him from their social media platform./*~*/However, the page soon reappeared, and denizens of the net immediately began to recall how profoundly they were affected by the brief period of time in which the President’s Twitter page no longer hung over their lives like a cursed, blackened cloud, ready to strike them dead in 280 characters or less./*~*/For scientific purposes I have saved some of these social media updates, and curiously found they all share a similar message of levity felt by those with the bizarre notion that Trump’s Twitter is somehow intrinsically linked to his role as President of the United States./*~*/Their year is either going exceptionally well, or Trump’s tweets are worse than mom’s recent cancer diagnosis./*~*/A new medical condition will be added to the upcoming ICD-11 described as chronic pain associated with the president’s Twitter account./*~*/Trump’s Twitter vanishing is equal to the blissful reprieve of Canzonetta sull’aria playing between repeated instances of prison rape./*~*/“Sorry, these tickets to Switzerland are great and all… But Trump’s Twitter being down for five minutes wins this year’s Best Birthday Present Award by a country mile!”/*~*/“Alright, we’re bombing North Korea, but first thing’s first: Delete my Twitter account!”/*~*/I guess the same person updates both Slate and Yahoo’s Facebook pages./*~*/
