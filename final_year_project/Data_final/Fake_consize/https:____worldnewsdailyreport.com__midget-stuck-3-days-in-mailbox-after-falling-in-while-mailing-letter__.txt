Content :49-year old Walter Morrison, from Fayetteville in North Carolina, was found on Monday morning by a postal employee collecting the mail./*~*/The 3’10” tall man was unconscious and severely dehydrated, so he was rapidly transported to the nearby Cape Fear Valley Medical Center where he was admitted in a critical condition./*~*/Thomas Dunsmore, the mailman who found Mr. Morrison, described the scene in an interview with MSNBC./*~*/He had just finished extracting the poor man from the narrow container when the paramedics arrived a few minutes later./*~*/Tom Dunmore, who saved Mr. Morrison’s life, told MSNBC that he’d found many strange things in mailboxes over his 30-year career, but this was “by far the most disturbing”./*~*/Fortunately, the medical staff was able to stabilize Mr. Morrison after a few hours of intensive care, and he regained consciousness the next morning./*~*/According to doctors, he broke his left thumb and his right foot, but should suffer no long-term physical consequences from his misadventure./*~*/Mr. Morrison says he fell in in the box on Friday morning while attempting to mail a letter and was unable to get out./*~*/He claims the accident was in part due to the fact that the mailbox was almost 40 years old and wasn’t as safe as the new ones./*~*/In fact, some employees of the U.S. postal services replaced it only hours later be a new one, suggesting this claim may be at least partially true./*~*/
