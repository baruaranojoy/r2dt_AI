Content :In an exclusive interview broadcasted this morning on RTÉ, Angus Brennan from Watergrasshill, near Cork, says he was milking his cows on Saturday when he was hit on the head from behind with a shovel or similar tool./*~*/The attack knocked him out, and when he woke up a few hours later, he had been tied up to a support beam inside his own barn./*~*/The 54-year old farmer says he was repeatedly raped over the next 40 hours by a “waist-high midget with a red beard and a cocked hat”./*~*/According to Mr. Brennan, the “leprechaun” raped him more than 20 times over the weekend before leaving for some unknown reason./*~*/Gardaí officers and paramedics arrived on the site within minutes and found Mr. Brennan lying in a pool of his own blood./*~*/He was transported to the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork where doctors observed “obvious signs of a violent sexual aggression”./*~*/It’s rather improbable that the rapist turns out to be a Leprechaun, a type of fairy in Irish folklore usually depicted as little bearded men who partake in mischief./*~*/In April 2015, a Welsh man reported being assaulted and robbed by a pair of “evil-looking leprechauns” armed with knives./*~*/In June 2012, in Seattle, a man who was found covered in blood outside a bar reported being assaulted by “a bunch of leprechauns”./*~*/In 2006, a leprechaun sighting in Mobile drew large crowds and even forced police intervention./*~*/
