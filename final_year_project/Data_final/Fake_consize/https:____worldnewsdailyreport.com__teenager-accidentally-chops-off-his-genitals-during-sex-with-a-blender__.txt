Content :16-year old Brian Johnson was apparently alone in his parents’ house and decided to engage in sexual intercourse with various objects around the residence./*~*/This strange sexual orgy could have continued for hours, but it was suddenly interrupted by a terrible accident./*~*/The young man had his genitals inside the electric blender and he accidentally hit one of the appliance’s button, activating it./*~*/According to Jeremy Morane, one of the paramedics who transported the teenager, the quantity of blood on the scene was a testimony to the violence of the accident./*~*/Mr. Morane claims the young man lost more than five pints of blood and is extremely lucky to be alive./*~*/Fortunately for him, Brian Johnson was transported to the Citizens Memorial Hospital just in time, and doctors were able to stabilize him./*~*/The paramedics Jeremy Morane and Jason Norris probably saved the young man’s life with their rapid intervention./*~*/Mr. Johnson’s terrible emasculation may seem unusual, but accidents of sexual nature involving everyday items are actually pretty common in the United States./*~*/The items most commonly implicated are shower heads, TV remote controls, toilet brushes and vacuum cleaners./*~*/Incidents involving blenders are rather rare, however, and the most recent occurred in 2007 when a 47-year man from Illinois died under similar circumstances./*~*/
