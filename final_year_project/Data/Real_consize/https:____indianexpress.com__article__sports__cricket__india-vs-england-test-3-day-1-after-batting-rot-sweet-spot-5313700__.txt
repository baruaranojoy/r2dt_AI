Content :Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane (below) added 159 runs for the fourth wicket on Day 1./*~*/The gaping hole in the wagon wheel showed England that Indians were in for a fight./*~*/The pair added 107 in 29.2 overs in that session to propel India towards a position of strength before two mental errors brought England back in to the game./*~*/If the conditions demanded that he needed to shelve or be cautious with the drives against seamers in the arena where it was supposed to swing, he would do it./*~*/Itâ€™s a ground in Nottingham, almost made for swing, the seamers were spent, and a hundred was just a shot away./*~*/He had had an iffy time series: not because of lack of touch but because of his penchant to keep feeling for the ball, away from the body./*~*/A curler in the temptation zone arrived from Stuart Broad, Rahane went for the booming cover drive and he would still have escaped but Alastair Cook, at first slip, put out his left hand even as the ball had flashed past him to come with a blinder./*~*/Two mental errors from the pair had brought England back in the game and they pressed further by taking out Hardik Pandya in the last over of the day./*~*/Not only had Rahane had contributed but Shikhar Dhawan , who replaced M Vijay, had looked as compact as he has ever been, playing very late, to set up the base for Indian middle order./*~*/If the lower order can contribute some runs, the bowlers would have something to bowl with for the first time in the series./*~*/
