Content :The number of young people applying to become Anglican priests has risen by almost a third in the past two years after efforts by the Church of England to ensure its ageing population of vicars will have a new cohort to replace them./*~*/Figures for 2018 show that 169 people under the age of 32 have been recommended for training as clergy, compared with 128 in 2016./*~*/More than half the total – 54% – are women, although they are concentrated in older age groups./*~*/The C of E has a target to increase the number of candidates for ordination by 50% by 2020 so it can reduce the impact of retirements over the next decade./*~*/Although the rising number of young ordinands is encouraging for the church, they are outnumbered by the 223 who are aged between 40 and 54./*~*/Ben Brady, 21, who will start a three-year residential course at Ridley Hall in Cambridge next month, said the growing number of young people entering training was a “sign of hope for the future”./*~*/He has spent the past year on a “ministry experience” scheme in Moss Side and Whalley Range in Manchester, helping with services, baptisms, funerals and hospital visiting, which he said “helped confirm my calling to the priesthood”./*~*/According to the church’s latest ministry statistics, 6.2% of new ordinands who reported their ethnicity last year identified themselves as being from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background, compared with 3.8% of existing paid clergy./*~*/In total, there were just over 20,000 ordained ministers serving in the C of E at the end of last year./*~*/The shortage of ministers has required one in four paid clergy to take on additional roles, including looking after more than one church./*~*/
