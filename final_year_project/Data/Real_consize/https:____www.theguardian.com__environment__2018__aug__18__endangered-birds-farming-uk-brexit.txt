Content :That is the stark conclusion of Michael Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB , who has warned that parliamentary bills – to be published over the next year – will have to make crucial changes to the way our farms and fisheries are run if the wildlife and landscape of the nation are to be rescued from their dangerously depleted condition./*~*/The three forthcoming bills – on agriculture, on fisheries and on the environment – will replace the EU legislation that currently controls our farming, fishing industry and the quality of our air, water and wildlife./*~*/Similarly a study, published by a team led by Adam Watson, of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, showed numbers of hares in the eastern Scottish highlands have plummeted by 99% since the middle of the 20th century./*~*/The CAP stresses the importance of agricultural output above all else and has helped destroy the homes and food sources of countless birds, animals and insects, said Clarke./*~*/Photograph: RSPB
Crucially, as Britain prepares to withdraw from the CAP and the EU, the nation has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put right this damage, said Clarke./*~*/The forthcoming agriculture bill needs to ensure that some of that money goes on maintaining the ecological quality of farms and the countryside.” Failing to do so would have appalling consequences, he added./*~*/The turtle dove feeds its young on the seeds of a range of wild flowers that have, over the years, been uprooted to provide land for intensive farming./*~*/“Farmers need help and cash to return some of this land to protected, ecologically rich countryside and so save the turtle dove and other threatened species./*~*/These goals are not pious: conservationists point out that the cirl, or village, bunting, was hurtling, like the turtle dove, towards extinction in the 1990s and for similar reasons but was rescued after farmers were persuaded to make slight changes in farming practices that helped preserve food stocks and restored numbers to encouraging levels./*~*/We need to set strong targets for recovering our lost biodiversity as well as establishing standards for improving the quality of our soil, air, and water./*~*/
