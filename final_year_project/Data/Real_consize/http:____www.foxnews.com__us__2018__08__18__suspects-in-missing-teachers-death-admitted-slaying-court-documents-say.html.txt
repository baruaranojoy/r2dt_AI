Content :Two former students of a south Georgia teacher missing since 2005 told friends at a party that they had killed her and burned her body, new court documents suggest./*~*/Documents filed this week in Irwin County Superior Court said their comments were reported to police but they weren't arrested until 2017./*~*/Ryan Alexander Duke, shown in February 2017, is one of the suspects in the disappearance and murder of Tara Grinstead./*~*/"It is undisputed that Irwin County law enforcement knew of these crimes within months of the disappearance of Tara Grinstead," a court motion states./*~*/"In fact, a search of the area where Ms. Grinstead's body was allegedly burned was conducted ... "/*~*/Duke's attorneys say in court motions that because it took so long to arrest them, all but the murder charge should be dropped, due to the statute of limitations./*~*/Grinstead, 30, an Irwin County High School teacher and former beauty queen, was last seen Oct. 22, 2005, when she left a cookout and said she was going straight home./*~*/A latex glove — the type worn by police officers and medical workers — was found in her front yard./*~*/In another motion, Duke's attorney asked that his indictment be dismissed because the language used is too "vague, ambitious and indefinite."/*~*/In June 2017, Dukes was indicted on charges including concealing a death, tampering with evidence, and hindering apprehension of a criminal./*~*/
