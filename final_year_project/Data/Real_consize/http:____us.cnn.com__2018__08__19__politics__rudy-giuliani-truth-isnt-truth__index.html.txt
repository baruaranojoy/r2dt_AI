Content :"Donald Trump says I didn't talk about [former national security adviser Michael] Flynn with [then-FBI Director James] Comey./*~*/This isn't the first time in recent days that Giuliani has spoken about the truth and facts this way./*~*/During an appearance on CNN's "Cuomo Prime Time" on Tuesday evening, Giuliani told CNN's Chris Cuomo that facts are in the eye of the beholder./*~*/The President's outside legal team for the special counsel investigation, which is headed up by Giuliani, replied to Mueller's proposal for terms of possible presidential testimony earlier this month, but the former New York mayor wouldn't disclose the details of his team's response./*~*/Trump has said he is willing to speak with Mueller's team, but his legal team has expressed opposition to that possibility because they believe the special counsel's investigators could take what Trump says, if it differs from what others have laid out, as a lie./*~*/"They have two pieces of evidence," Giuliani said to Todd on Sunday morning, explaining his stance./*~*/Truth has always been the touchstone of our country's justice system and political life./*~*/If we are untethered to truth, our justice system cannot function and a society based on the rule of law dissolves," Comey tweeted./*~*/Last week, Giuliani told CNN's Jake Tapper that if the President sits down for questioning by special counsel Mueller, Trump will say he never discussed easing up on a probe of former national security adviser Flynn with Comey./*~*/Not the truth," Giuliani told NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday morning during "Meet the Press."/*~*/
