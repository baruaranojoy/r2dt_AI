Content :Why operate in the shadows when you can command airtime on Sydney radio station 2GB, or when your former chief of staff has her own show, or when your loyal supporters - men like Craig Kelly, who only a handful of voters could pick out of a line-up - are awarded constant appearances on nightly TV?/*~*/But the best advancement of Abbott’s agenda - to torpedo the National Energy Guarantee, to junk the Paris agreement targets, to kneecap Malcolm Turnbull - has not been through straight reporting, but from editorialising by his friends in the media./*~*/Shock jocks Alan Jones and Ray Hadley, climate change denier Andrew Bolt, and Abbott’s former chief of staff Peta Credlin, have all used their platforms to attack Turnbull and denounce his energy policy./*~*/“My judgement of you is that you’ve sold your political soul for the sake of ministerial office!” Jones told Frydenberg in April, jabbing a stumpy, Jonesian finger in the minister’s face as he sat in the studio./*~*/On Thursday, Dutton did his usual spot on Ray Hadley's show and stated the obvious, but with apparent intent: that if he found he couldn't support government policy, he would resign his ministership and go on the back bench./*~*/Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton does a regular radio interview with Macquarie Media host Ray Hadley./*~*/Later that day, Ray Hadley phoned his colleague Chris Smith, while on air, and told 2GB listeners that a challenge to the Prime Minister was “happening, for sure and certain”./*~*/Meanwhile, the after-dark Sky News commentators, including Andrew Bolt, Paul Murray, Peta Credlin and co, have maintained high levels of criticism of the government in general, and the Prime Minister in particular./*~*/While the vast majority of Australians do not watch Sky, it has a disproportionate influence in Canberra, where it appears around every corner, on every screen, like the political shadow you can’t run from, or, in its nastier incarnations, the ghastly portrait in your attic./*~*/It is a small number of right-wing conservatives who have torpedoed the NEG, the policy that was supposed to be the grace note of the Turnbull prime ministership, the full stop at the end of the ideological energy wars we have tediously waged in this country for a decade./*~*/
