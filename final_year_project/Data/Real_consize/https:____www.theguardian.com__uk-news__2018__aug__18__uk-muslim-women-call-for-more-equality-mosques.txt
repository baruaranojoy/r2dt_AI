Content :Muslim women in Scotland are campaigning to be given more equal facilities for praying and to be involved in running mosques./*~*/More than a quarter of mosques in the UK have no facilities for women and, in the remainder, access is often restricted and the space they are given inadequate./*~*/The organisation said: “It is unfortunate that many mosques fail to provide basic access for Muslim women to use the facility to pray or the quality of the space can often be inadequate and not suitable./*~*/It added: “The place and role of women in mosques is in real crisis in the UK and elsewhere and this status quo must change.”/*~*/Anita Nayyar, who launched Open My Mosque in February, told the online magazine Khouj Women : “My right as a religious minority is protected in the workplace, but how is my right as a woman protected when mosques are turning me away?/*~*/The Charities Commission should be ensuring that mosques with charitable status were serving all of their community, and planning authorities should only give permission for new mosques to be built if they provided good quality space and access for women, she said./*~*/The alliance aims “to empower Muslim women by helping them become leaders, make positive impacts in their communities and enhance their own lives”./*~*/It says its core values of integrity, generosity, compassion and leadership “are defined by our Islamic ideals … As individuals we have our own strengths but as a united sisters’ alliance, we are even stronger and more capable together.”/*~*/The first female-led mosque in Scandinavia opened in Copenhagen two years ago, with two female imams leading prayers./*~*/Scottish Mosques For All declined a request to be interviewed by the Observer , but a message on its Facebook page last week stressed that it aimed “to work together with mosques to highlight the excellent work they do and support them to improve in other areas, in particular facilities and services for women”./*~*/
