Content :The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) is heavily reliant on "big brother" Turkey due to its political and economic isolation from the rest of the world, a result of its official break from the Greek Cypriot south in 1983./*~*/The Turkish third of the eastern Mediterranean island uses the lira for day-to-day business but many items such as cars and electronic goods, as well as property costs, are priced in foreign currency - leaving the territory's 300,000 inhabitants facing a greater threat from fluctuations than those in Turkey./*~*/By using the lira, TRNC, which had a trade deficit of $1.67bn last year, is deprived of many of the vital economic tools - such as raising interest rates - that could help it keep down the cost of living./*~*/"One of the main problems is that people mostly earn in lira but many costs such as housing, cars and computers are priced in pounds, euro or dollars," she added./*~*/Yenal Surec, a senior economics lecturer at Eastern Mediterranean University in Famagusta, said the most important effect of the lira's devaluation would be on inflation, which currently stands at 20.3 percent./*~*/Turkish Cypriots are understandably nervous of price rises, creating an "atmosphere of panic" when the lira plunged to below seven to the dollar earlier this week," said Surec./*~*/The island's north is heavily dependent on tourism and universities to draw in foreign currency, as well as investment and other financial support from Turkey, the only country that recognises the breakaway republic./*~*/However, Rustu Yucel, an economics columnist for the Diyalog newspaper, said the bank had added to the crisis by raising the public's appetite for foreign currency credit in recent years through low interest rates./*~*/Yucel condemned the steps taken by the government as "symptomatic" policies that failed to address debt problems and warned of bankruptcies as people defaulted on foreign currency loans./*~*/"The [Turkish Cypriot] government will demand extra finance from Ankara because the exchange rate increase was not foreseen," Surec, the university lecturer, said./*~*/
