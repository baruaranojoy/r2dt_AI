Content :New Zealand's hands are tied when it comes to taking in refugees from Nauru, with both the Pacific nation's government and Australia rejecting a resettlement offer, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says./*~*/Charity World Vision on Monday called on Ms Ardern to bypass Australia and deal directly with Nauru's government to urgently relocate 119 children from the island to New Zealand./*~*/But Ms Ardern told reporters in Wellington her government had already made its standing offer to take in 150 detainees to Nauruan authorities - only to be turned down./*~*/The government in Nauru has continued to point out they wish to work directly with Australia," she said, adding the offer still stood./*~*/World Vision New Zealand director Grant Bayldon says the children are living in sub-standard conditions./*~*/Kelly Nicholls from the Refugee Council of Australia said there was a deep concern for all those detained offshore, and for children in particular./*~*/"Worryingly, in recent months, there has been an escalation of reports of children suffering 'resignation syndrome' where they aren't leaving their beds and they've stopping eating, drinking, talking - even going to the toilet," she said./*~*/Since 2013, New Zealand has had on the table an offer to relocate 150 asylum seekers from Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea - with the Ardern government ramping up the push./*~*/Australia has repeatedly declined, citing concerns it would be used by people smugglers to lure more asylum seekers onto boats by advertising New Zealand as a backdoor./*~*/Australian Labor on Monday penned a letter to Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton calling for him to accept the New Zealand offer, joining a chorus of charity groups calling for the children to be brought to Australia./*~*/
