Content :An ice addict who murdered his partner in a squat house and then stole her bank card in an effort to get more money for drugs has been jailed for 25 years./*~*/Phuc Thien Tang bashed Hoa Thi Huynh with a vacuum cleaner pipe in the early hours of September 7 last year, during an argument about his drug use in the St Albans house where they were squatters./*~*/Photo: Age Library After beating her with the metal pipe, Tang stabbed Ms Huynh through the left nostril with a 73-centimetre samurai sword, penetrating 17 centimetres into her brain./*~*/Tang then changed his clothes, hid Ms Huynh’s bag in the garage and took her bank card to an ATM, where he tried to withdraw cash but was unsuccessful./*~*/In the weeks before the murder, Tang had been bailed over allegations he used the sword and an imitation pistol to threaten a man Ms Huynh had been in a brief relationship with./*~*/‘‘The murder of Lina Huynh was a savage and vicious crime during which you employed two different weapons,’’ Justice Taylor told Tang in the Supreme Court./*~*/Tang told police he injected ice at another house in St Albans before the murder and "whacked" Ms Huynh because she was "nagging" him about his drug use./*~*/Tang has had drug addictions dating back to his early 20s when he first used heroin, and a 20-year criminal history, mostly related to thefts to support his habits./*~*/Justice Taylor acknowledged Tang pleaded guilty but found his ice use to be an aggravating factor, rather than explanatory, given he knew its dangers./*~*/Ms Huynh worked at a restaurant in Chinatown, and her death was felt deeply by her two adult sons, the court heard, who missed the ordinary interactions with their mother and shared a profound sadness she wouldn't be there for their life milestones./*~*/
