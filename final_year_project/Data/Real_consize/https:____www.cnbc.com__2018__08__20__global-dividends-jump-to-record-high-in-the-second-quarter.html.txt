Content :Payments rose in almost every region of the world in headline terms and records were broken in 12 countries including France, Japan, and the U.S./*~*/This comes amid warnings from analysts that the looming trade war and punitive tariffs from the U.S. and China could pose a risk for equities across the globe./*~*/"Rising corporate profitability is driving higher dividend payments in all parts of the world," the global asset manager said in its report, published Monday, "Exchange-rate effects exaggerated the headline performance./*~*/Even so, on an underlying basis, Janus Henderson's measure of core trends, global payouts grew 9.5 percent, the fastest increase in three years," the asset manager said./*~*/Underlying growth here was the strongest since the second quarter of 2015 with European companies paying a record $176.5 billion, an increase of 18.7 percent year-on-year, as higher corporate profits in 2017 flowed into dividends, the report noted./*~*/Only one company in 50 in the U.S. cut its payout, Janus Henderson noted, with the largest firm to do so being GE as it commenced a restructuring program and a bid to reduce its debts./*~*/The resurgent dollar, up 4.45 percent year to date against a basket of major currencies however, is offsetting the improvement, the report added./*~*/"Dividends in the second half will be translated at less favorable exchange rates, so Janus Henderson's forecast of $1.358 trillion is unchanged, an increase of 8.6 percent in headline terms year-on-year."/*~*/"Nevertheless, we are still optimistic that in aggregate corporate earnings can continue to grow next year, and payout ratios in key parts of the world like Japan have scope to rise further too."/*~*/He noted that "dividends in any case are less volatile than profits, and we are confident that 2019 will see the global total continue to rise in underlying terms./*~*/
