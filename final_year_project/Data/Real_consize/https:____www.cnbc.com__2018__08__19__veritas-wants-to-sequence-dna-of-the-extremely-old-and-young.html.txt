Content :Considering how many people struggle with memory loss due to age and disease, there's naturally a lot of interest in knowing how Dellis' brain works./*~*/Veritas, located north of Boston, is among a handful of emerging companies providing the tools for humans to map their genome at a price, $1,000 each, that almost brings it into the mainstream./*~*/"I think studying these extreme cases is a really interesting approach," said Robert Green, a medical geneticist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a consultant to Veritas./*~*/Scientists in the past decade uncovered two women with very low LDL cholesterol levels , who turned out to have the identical double dose of an extremely rare gene mutation./*~*/That discovery set off a chase among the world's largest pharmaceutical companies to get approval for a drug that imitates the effect of that mutation./*~*/More than 100 years Preston Estep, Veritas' co-founder and chief scientific officer, has a particular interest in the really old, as well as "super humans" like Dellis and Trubridge./*~*/Estimates suggest that there are between a few hundred and 1,000 super-centenarians in the world, and a disproportionate number live in the Mediterranean region and Japan, so finding them is a challenge for Veritas./*~*/Diets that involve a lot of fresh fruit and fish are clearly a factor, given the parts of the world where these people tend to reside./*~*/And Veritas, along with a number of universities, is also looking at ways to collect smaller saliva samples, so infants won't be subjected to a blood draw./*~*/They're also still exploring the costs and the implications for privacy, given that there are no legal protections in the U.S. to prevent life insurers and long-term disability companies from denying coverage based on DNA data./*~*/
