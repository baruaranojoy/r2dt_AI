Content :To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we can look at a post-election Pew Research Center study with verified voters./*~*/(Note: Trump's approval rating with blacks in a Pew poll in June, not included in our average, was 14%./*~*/Even with averaging, the African-American subsample in these polls is small enough that our current estimateof Trump's approval rating comes with a fairly wide margin of error./*~*/That's why I decided to look at the President's average approval rating since April in Gallup's tracking poll ./*~*/That said, there doesn't seem to be any sign of that in polling from Marist College , Quinnipiac , Pew or the The Washington Post ./*~*/The Democratic margin on the generic congressional ballot with black voters isn't any greater in these polls than Trump's net approval rating among them would imply./*~*/It just seems that for whatever reason the President has picked up a small, but statistically significant, amount of support among African-Americans./*~*/The fact that he has done so while losing support among all other racial groups makes it that much more impressive./*~*/They make up greater than 10% of the US electorate, and more in key swing states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia./*~*/What's the point: There is another poll out in which more than 30% of black voters supposedly approve of Trump's job performance./*~*/
