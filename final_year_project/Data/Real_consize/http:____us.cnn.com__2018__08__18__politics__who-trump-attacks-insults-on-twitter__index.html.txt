Content :Trump has repeatedly attacked the protesters, accusing them, as he did in an October 2017 tweet, of "showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country."/*~*/(Trump called Arianna Huffington "a dog who wrongfully comments on me" a few months before beginning his 2016 campaign.)/*~*/In June 2017, Trump singled out then 50-year-old Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's "Morning Joe," in a tweet disparaging her appearance and intellect:/*~*/Trump has also used the "low IQ" insult against actor Robert De Niro and, a few weeks later, Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is black./*~*/During his time on the job, the President has singled out on Twitter at least two corporate CEOs : Ken Frazier of the pharmaceutical giant Merck, who is black, and Disney's Bob Iger, who is white./*~*/Recent attacks on a pair of female figures , both with connections to men Trump has sought to discredit in relation to the Russia probe, have also brought attention to the way he addresses women -- thinly cloaking his obvious contempt with loaded allusions to their appearances./*~*/Before entering the White House, Trump tended to be more direct with his insults, as former Fox News host Megyn Kelly noted during the first Republican primary debate ./*~*/Trump's attacks may have hit a new low this week with his dehumanizing tweet about former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, calling the only African-American to serve in a senior role in his White House a "dog."/*~*/Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has directly insulted, attacked or otherwise maligned nearly 100 individuals , according to our unscientific review of his feed./*~*/Nor does it include the estimated 200 NFL players -- almost all of them black -- who have knelt or in some other way protested racial inequality and police brutality during the National Anthem and been assailed by the President for it./*~*/
