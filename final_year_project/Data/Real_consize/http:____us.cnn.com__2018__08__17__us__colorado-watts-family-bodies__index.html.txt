Content :"I have a lot experience taking samples from dead bodies getting good results after strangulation," Eikelenbloom wrote to the court./*~*/The Weld County coroner's office confirmed three bodies found Thursday are those of Shanann Watts, who was 15 weeks pregnant, and her two daughters./*~*/The cause of death for each family member remains pending while medical investigators wait on test results, a news release from the Frederick Police Department said./*~*/CNN affiliate KMGH aired video showing Chris Watts' pickup truck being towed from the family's home overnight, as well as investigators removing items from the house in garbage bags./*~*/Watts said he left for work about 5:15 a.m. that day and wasn't concerned when Shanann didn't respond to his texts and phone calls because she was probably busy with her job, having just returned from being out of town./*~*/An unidentified friend told KDVR that she dropped off Shanann Watts at home about 2 a.m. Monday after they returned from a work trip, and watched her go into the house./*~*/When asked whether other people were involved, Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director John Camper said, "In terms of any danger to the community, we're not concerned about that at all."/*~*/Anadarko Petroleum Corporation spokeswoman Jennifer Brice said Watts is a former employee, but declined to say when he left the company./*~*/In a second motion, obtained by CNN affiliate KDVR , defense attorneys asked the court to compel the coroner's office to look for DNA under the mother's fingernails and on her hands./*~*/CNN's Sheena Jones, Marlena Baldacci, Joe Sutton and Dave Alsup contributed to this report./*~*/
