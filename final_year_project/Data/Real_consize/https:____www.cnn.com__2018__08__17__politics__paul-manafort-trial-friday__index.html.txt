Content :Trump has repeatedly called the probe a "witch hunt" that hasn't found evidence of Russian collusion with his campaign, and his allies in and out of the White House say the special counsel should wrap things up./*~*/A Manafort conviction would allow Democrats and Mueller's supporters to say ending the investigation would be premature./*~*/It could also boost Mueller's position as he negotiates with Trump's lawyers over a potential interview./*~*/I'd imagine they would too," Ellis said, adding that US marshals accompany him everywhere, including an unnamed hotel where he's staying, but jurors don't have that protection./*~*/The ruling is not a gag order, and jurors will be free to make individual decisions after the trial about whether to speak to the media./*~*/Ellis does plan to make public all bench conferences currently under seal with one exception -- likely the part of the trial where the special counsel's office discussed its ongoing investigation./*~*/Manafort also was charged with receiving loans from the Federal Savings Bank after one of its executives sought a position in the Trump campaign and administration, according to prosecutors./*~*/Defense attorney Richard Westling said Manafort became the special counsel's victim in a "selective process of pulling" his financial records to concoct a narrative of an "elaborate fraud scheme."/*~*/Manafort's defense attorney Kevin Downing told reporters they "really appreciate the support of President Trump."/*~*/Manafort is charged with 18 counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and hiding foreign bank accounts brought by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election./*~*/
