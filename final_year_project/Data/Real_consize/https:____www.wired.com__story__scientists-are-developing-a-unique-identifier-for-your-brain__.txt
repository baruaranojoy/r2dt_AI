Content :Michaela Cordova , a research associate and lab manager at Oregon Health and Science University, begins by “de-metaling”: removing rings, watches, gadgets and other sources of metal, double-checking her pockets for overlooked objects that could, in her words, “fly in.” Then she enters the scanning room, raises and lowers the bed, and waves a head coil in the general direction of the viewing window and the iPad camera that’s enabling this virtual lab tour (I’m watching from thousands of miles away in Massachusetts)./*~*/The lab where Cordova works, headed by associate professor Damien Fair , is concerned with the functional connectome, the map of brain regions that coordinate to carry out specific tasks and to influence behavior./*~*/Identifying, tracking and modeling the functional connectome could expose how brain signatures lead to variations in behavior and, in some cases, confer a higher risk of developing certain neuropsychiatric conditions./*~*/Damien Fair (at right), an associate professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University, heads a lab that maps how brain areas work together during tasks and behaviors./*~*/With colleagues such as assistant professor Oscar Miranda-Dominguez (at center) and research associate Michaela Cordova (at left), Fair turns MRI data from human subjects into profiles of the functional “connectome.”/*~*/Since certain mental conditions also tend to run in families, Fair’s mission to detect heritable connections might eventually help discern the parts of the brain and genes that increase a person’s risk of developing specific disorders./*~*/Investigating the role of genetics and environment on brain circuits first involved using a sorting algorithm known as a classifier to divide the tested individuals into two groups, “related” and “unrelated,” based on their functional fingerprints./*~*/The model’s ability to draw nuanced distinctions between family members, he added, was remarkable, because the researchers had trained the classifier to delineate only “related” and “unrelated,” rather than degrees of relatedness./*~*/While Fair and Miranda in Oregon characterize the genetic underpinnings of the functional connectome, at King’s College London the research fellow James Cole is hard at work using neuroimaging and machine learning to decrypt the heritability of brain age./*~*/The data came straight off the MRI scanner, and included images of the whole head, complete with nose, ears, tongue, spinal cord and, in some cases, a bit of fat around the neck./*~*/
