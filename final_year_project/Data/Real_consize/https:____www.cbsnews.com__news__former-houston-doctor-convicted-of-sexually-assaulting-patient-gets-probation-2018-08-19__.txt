Content :Dr. Shafeeq Sheikh 's punishment has surprised defense attorneys, disappointed law enforcement and raised concerns from a victims advocacy group, the Houston Chronicle reported ./*~*/Sheikh was sentenced Friday, a day after a Harris County jury of five women and seven men found him guilty after 14 hours of deliberations./*~*/He acknowledged at trial that he had sexual contact with the woman during the night shift at Ben Taub hospital in 2013 but told jurors it was consensual./*~*/Prosecutors said the woman was weak, sore and medicated following several acute asthma episodes./*~*/The victim, who is now 32, testified that a doctor came to her bedside in the dark and began touching her breasts during a chest exam./*~*/"When you're a doctor, I'd expect you'd get prison time," said attorney Casey Kiernan, who has defended sexual assault cases for nearly four decades./*~*/His lawyer, Stanley Schneider, asked the jury to have mercy on a man who had a wife and children and no prior felonies./*~*/Sonia Corrales, chief program officer at the Houston Area Women's Center, was unfamiliar with the case but said there should be equity in sentencing violent offenders./*~*/"Oftentimes, perpetrators will attempt to minimize the severity of their actions by claiming it wasn't sexual assault, but was consensual sex," she said./*~*/"Sexual violence is a willful choice a perpetrator makes to harm another human being and should be addressed by the criminal justice system with the same severity as any other violent crime."/*~*/
