Content :The LA branch of Taiwanese-owned 85C Bakery Cafe gave the coffee, along with an enthusiastic welcome, to Tsai Ing-wen when she dropped in last Sunday./*~*/China regards Taiwan as part of its territory, and the Chinese public are often quick to jump on anything that is seen as endorsing Taiwanese independence./*~*/Yet, when the bakery chain tried some damage control, quickly putting out a statement distancing itself from pro-independence sentiments, it only sparked more anger - this time in Taiwan, where people accused the company of bowing to Chinese pressure./*~*/It's a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1950, when China's nationalist government was defeated by communist forces and fled there from the mainland./*~*/Last weekend, President Tsai Ing-wen stopped over in Los Angeles on her way to visit some of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies in South America./*~*/The local staff, apparently excited to host her, gave her a gift bag, and among smiles and photographs also handed her a brand mascot to sign./*~*/Although Ms Tsai has been a moderate voice on the independence issue since her election, she is viewed by the mainland as a dangerous separatist./*~*/Image copyrightEPAImage caption
Taiwan remains defiant of Beijing's sovereignty claims
The cafe said it was against anything that would "divide the feelings of the compatriots on the two sides", which were "the same family"./*~*/Chinese customers cried foul when they realised the statement was only published on the company's mainland website, seeing it as an attempt to mollify the public without taking a clear anti-independence stance./*~*/But this week, one hotel in Taiwan said it was cutting all ties with the Marriott franchise as a result, accusing it of giving in to the Chinese demands./*~*/
