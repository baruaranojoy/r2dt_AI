Content :In Tuesday's report, the grand jury said internal documents from six Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania showed that more than 300 "predator priests" were credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims since 1947./*~*/But because of a variety of factors -- such as the statute of limitations expiring, or the accused or accusers having died -- none of those roughly 30 Beaver County cases can be prosecuted, District Attorney David Lozier said./*~*/Often, he said, the most his office can do for victims is offer solace./*~*/Out of all the priests accused in Tuesday's report, two have been charged on suspicion of abusing minors -- one in Pennsylvania's Erie diocese, and another in the Greensburg diocese./*~*/The statute of limitations blocks quite a few prosecutions./*~*/Although state law currently allows child victims of sexual crimes to pursue criminal charges against their abusers until age 50 and lawsuits until age 30, that's only been the case in relatively recent years./*~*/Before, the state's limits for child sex abuse cases used to be five years for prosecution and two years for civil suits./*~*/The problem for some victims is that they crossed their statutes of limitations before the extensions came./*~*/US Supreme Court precedent prohibits extending prosecution windows after a limit expires./*~*/CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report./*~*/
