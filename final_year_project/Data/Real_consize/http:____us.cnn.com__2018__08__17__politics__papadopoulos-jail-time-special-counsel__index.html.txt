Content :Papadopoulos' initial interview with federal investigators in late January 2017 was months before the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller./*~*/Mueller's team said in their Friday filing that that early interview, part of a national security investigation, was "completely voluntary."/*~*/Among "at least a dozen" lies at the interview, Papadopoulos concealed the "significance" of when he had learned that Russians possessed thousands of emails about Clinton./*~*/On the same day as his interview, Papadopoulos applied for a deputy assistant secretary position in Trump's Department of Energy, according to the filing./*~*/Several Russians involved in the hacking of Clinton and Democratic email servers were criminally charged by Mueller's team about a month ago./*~*/An additional meeting in December where investigators wanted to ask Papadopoulos more questions -- two months after he cut his plea deal -- was canceled because he and his then-fianc√©e began giving interviews to media outlets./*~*/After Friday's filing, Papadopoulos' wife, Simona Mangiante, told CNN she felt her husband should pull out of the plea agreement, saying he hadn't had proper representation in the negotiation with the government./*~*/Papadopoulos' lawyer Thomas Breen said Friday night that he was unable to comment at this time and would respond through the court record in their own pre-sentencing memo, which must be filed by Aug. 31./*~*/Special counsel prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence Papadopoulos to up to six months in prison, according to a court filing on Friday./*~*/"The defendant's lies undermined investigators' ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States," prosecutors wrote./*~*/
