Content :“Sales have been impacted by customers adjusting to the phasing-out of single-use plastic bags, a competitor continuity program (Little Shop), meat and fruit and vegetable deflation, and the cycling of our successful Earn and Learn program in the prior year,” Woolworths group chief executive Brad Banducci said in a statement./*~*/In response to bans in some states and territories, Woolworths and Coles chose to remove single-use plastic bags from their entire store networks from July 1, leading to customer complaints./*~*/“Our customer satisfaction metrics are broadly back to levels prior to the removal of single-use plastic bags, including Time in Queue.”/*~*/Speaking to analysts, Mr Banducci said the plastic bag ban had resulted in customers buying fewer items per shop, while the Coles Little Shop had reduced the overall number of visits “particularly with grandparents buying plastic toys for their kids”./*~*/He admitted the supermarket had been caught off guard by the reaction to the plastic bag ban and would have done things differently “a second time around”, but “wouldn’t have changed our decision”./*~*/Mr Banducci said whether Coles saw a sustained uplift after the six-week promotion ended depended on “how well we execute against our store experience”./*~*/Having fixed the basics, our focus is shifting to being ‘consistently good’ at the fundamentals and creating a meaningful shopping differentiation in the eyes of our customers.”/*~*/Struggling department store chain Big W posted a loss of $110 million, despite eking out positive same-store sales growth of 0.9 per cent./*~*/Last week, Coles reported same-store sales growth of just 1.1 per cent for the full year , but said momentum in the first quarter of 2019 had improved, “driven by a successful Little Shop campaign, other promotional initiatives implemented during the quarter, and improved store execution”./*~*/WOOLWORTHS has blamed poor sales in the first seven weeks of the financial year on “customers adjusting” to the plastic bag ban and Coles’ Little Shop miniature promotion./*~*/
