Content :Avenatti has made two trips to Ohio in as many weeks, where he met with David Betras, the chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, and had dinner with Rep. Tim Ryan, another possible 2020 Democratic contender who represents Youngstown./*~*/We went to dinner last week, he was in Youngstown and I really like him," Ryan told CNN after commending Avenatti's work against Trump over the last few months./*~*/The lawyer also made a trip to meet with Democratic officials in Pennsylvania before traveling to Iowa for the state fair, followed by a speaking slot at the 15th Annual Wing Ding fundraiser in Clear Lake, Iowa, where his fierce rhetoric was met with applause./*~*/"When they go low, I say, we hit harder," he said to a crowd of die-hard Iowa Democrats, a play on a phrase made famous by then-first lady Michelle Obama during the 2016 campaign in which her advice was to "go high."/*~*/Hosted in the Surf Ballroom, the site of Buddy Holly's last performance before his plane crashed nearby on "The Day The Music Died," it is a quintessential Iowa event./*~*/"I worked on two campaigns at the same time: Congressman Dick Gephardt's and a county executive race for George 'Buzz' Westfall," he said./*~*/Now he's thinking about jumping back into politics with fresh eyes after decades of work as an attorney, one that ended up suing the President on behalf of a porn star./*~*/"If you look at the '88 presidential campaign, Michael Dukakis got his butt kicked by Lee Atwater (George H. W. Bush's campaign manager at the time) partly due to an attack ad involving a man named Willie Horton./*~*/"Dukakis could have fought back, but he did not want to engage in a negative campaign and suffered the consequences for it."/*~*/Avenatti has said he is attending the events to talk to voters and listen to their concerns, but his actions speak louder than his words and Democrats close to the lawyer believe he is now seriously considering a 2020 run./*~*/
