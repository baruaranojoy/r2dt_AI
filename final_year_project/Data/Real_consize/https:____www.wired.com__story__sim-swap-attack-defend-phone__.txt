Content :SIM attacks appear to be behind a recent string of Instagram takeovers, as well as the very unfortunate, not great time a hacker posted Justin Bieber nudes from Selena Gomez’s account last year./*~*/A cryptocurrency investor this week claimed that a SIM swap resulted in the theft of $23.8 million-worth of tokens; he’s suing his carrier, AT&T, for 10 times that amount./*~*/And Motherboard recently documented a number of incidents in which SIM hijackers drained thousands of dollars out of people’s checking accounts./*~*/A sobering caveat: If a skilled SIM hijacker targets you, there’s realistically not much you can do to stop them, says Allison Nixon, threat research at security firm Flashpoint./*~*/Perfect security hygiene won’t always keep someone from fooling your carrier, and in fact, they may not even have to; Flashpoint has found some indications that SIM hijackers recruit retail workers at mobile shops to gain access to protected accounts./*~*/You should also add what the carrier calls “extra security,” which just means it’ll require the passcode to manage your account online or in a retail store./*~*/For T-Mobile, you have to call instead; dial 611 from your mobile phone and ask to add “Port Validation” to your account, which lets you choose a six to 15 digit PIN./*~*/“Most people have that turned off because if they can’t remember their PIN they can’t go into the local Verizon store and get a new phone,” says Chet Wisniewski, principle research scientist at security firm Sophos./*~*/Apps like Google Authenticator and Authy give you that extra layer of security like SMS-based two-factor does, but they also tie it to your physical device rather than the number the phone company assigned to you./*~*/But Wisniewski suggests that the added complexity it adds to your life might not be worth it for most people, especially since so many apps tie your account to the number associated with your phone./*~*/
