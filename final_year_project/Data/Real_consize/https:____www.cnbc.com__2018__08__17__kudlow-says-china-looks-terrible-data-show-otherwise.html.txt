Content :White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow says China's economy looks "terrible," and that investment there is "collapsing."/*~*/Kudlow also said the latest data showed that "retail sales, business investment is collapsing."/*~*/First, fixed asset investment did slow to 5.5 percent year-on-year growth in July, the lowest since 1999, according to Shanghai-based data company Wind Info./*~*/The economic growth rate is bound to decline in this process, since the labor productivity of the services industry is significantly lower than that of the manufacturing industry, according to Lu Zhang, a Beijing-based economist at investment research firm CEBM./*~*/Part of the weakness in the yuan is due to a slowing economy and easing domestic monetary policy./*~*/But at the same time, the U.S. dollar index has strengthened to its highest in more than a year amid Federal Reserve tightening./*~*/The official China Foreign Exchange Trade System RMB index, which tracks the yuan's moves against a weighted basket of currencies such as the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc, is down about 2 percent this year, according to Wind./*~*/However, Chinese acquisitions and investments in the U.S. dropped 92 percent to $1.8 billion in the first five months of this year, research and consulting firm Rhodium Group said./*~*/China does, however, face pressure as authorities try to reduce reliance on debt-driven growth, while the economy could also be affected if trade tensions with the U.S. escalate./*~*/Kudlow's remarks come as the U.S. and China agreed to resume negotiations on trade later this month ./*~*/
