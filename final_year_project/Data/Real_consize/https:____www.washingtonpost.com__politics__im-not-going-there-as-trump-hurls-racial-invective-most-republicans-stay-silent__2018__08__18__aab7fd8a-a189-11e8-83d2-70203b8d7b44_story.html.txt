Content :The president of the United States had just lobbed another racially charged insult — this time calling his former top African American adviser a “dog” — but Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)/*~*/The studied avoidance is a reflection of the enduring reluctance of Republicans to confront Trump’s often divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, in part because the ­president remains deeply popular within a party dominated by older white voters./*~*/3 Republican in the Senate, said Trump’s description of former black adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman as a “dog” was “not appropriate, ever.” But he stopped short of pointing to a time when he felt the president had crossed a racial boundary./*~*/At one point last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she could not guarantee that no audio recording exists of Trump using the n-word, as Manigault Newman alleges in her book./*~*/Four years later, Nixon further consolidated that bloc in his sweeping reelection victory, in part by picking up voters who had previously backed the White House bid of Democrat and segregationist George Wallace, who was shot and effectively sidelined during the 1972 campaign./*~*/Bush was rebuked by critics in 1988 for airing a television ad that showed the image of a convicted black murderer, Willie Horton, in arguing that his Democratic rival was soft on crime./*~*/As the Republican National Committee chairman in 2005, Ken Mehlman — who managed Bush’s reelection campaign — publicly apologized for Nixon’s “Southern strategy,” calling it “wrong.”/*~*/Jonathan V. Last, digital editor at the Weekly Standard, seemed to capture the quiet resignation facing many Republicans as he imagined, in a tweet, the party’s hypothetical response to actual audio surfacing of Trump saying the n-word./*~*/Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under George W. Bush and was an author of the autopsy report, said he believes that while Trump is squandering opportunities to win over minority voters, there exists a “line between being a boor and being a racist.”/*~*/But Republicans who believe that Trump has galloped past norms of civil society on race and other issues worry about the costs the party may ultimately pay, both politically and morally./*~*/
