Content :NEW DELHI: Alarm bells went off when June quarter attrition at Infosys spiked./*~*/The software biggie received a huge blow on Saturday when old hand Chief Financial Officer (CFO) M D Ranganath quit./*~*/The second-largest IT firm has informed stock exchanges that it will "immediately" start the search process for the next CFO./*~*/This is disconcerting, compounded by the fact that the spike in attrition of the last quarter also saw high performers exit," said Motilal Oswal Securities./*~*/Earlier in June, Sangita Singh, Executive Vice-President and head of the IT major's $750 million healthcare and life sciences business, and Nitesh Banga, Senior VP and Global Head of manufacturing and Edge products put in their papers./*~*/In January, Infosys President Rajesh Krishnamurthy too quit to join CMA CGM Group as Senior Vice-President of IT and Transformation./*~*/High attrition can be attributed to multiple factors in the past such as change in strategy and performance management systems, perceived underperformance of a few leaders leading to counseling them out and the CEO change in itself, Kotak Securities said./*~*/He worked on strategy, risk management and M&As and was instrumental in formulating and executing strategic priorities for the company./*~*/"But Infosys has demonstrated that it is a fantastic institution and it has managed the changes at the CEO level and seen other senior exits quite well./*~*/Motilal Oswal said that given continued work-in-progress nature as far as team stability goes, further accentuated by the CFOâ€™s exit, there is lesser case one can make for narrowing of the gap in the foreseeable period./*~*/
