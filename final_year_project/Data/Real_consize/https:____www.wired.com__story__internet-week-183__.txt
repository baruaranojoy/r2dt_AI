Content :Bad news for those hoping to see President Trump 's planned military parade this November: It’s postponed , perhaps because it was apparently going to cost more than $80 million more than originally estimated./*~*/And that was just one of a couple setbacks last week for Trump, who also got dinged by a federal judge who ruled the administration screwed up the wording on its controversial NDA forms./*~*/Also, the defense rested in the trial of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort last week without calling any witnesses , so the jury is expected to return a verdict very soon in that case./*~*/What Really Happened: Omarosa Manigault Newman continued the promo tour for her new book, Unhinged , last week with a strategy that is, shall we say, somewhat unique./*~*/What Happened: Folks spent a lot of time last week talking about the fact that Omarosa might have tapes of Trump./*~*/Penn Jillette has said the same thing , and then there’s Omarosa's recording of Trump insiders apparently confirming that they’ve heard a tape of him saying it, too./*~*/What Happened: As the White House removes the security clearance of one of its critics, politicians and the intelligence community respond in the manner you'd likely expect./*~*/What Really Happened: Some of you may or may not remember that, last month, there were storiesinthepress about the president considering stripping security clearance for former intelligent officials who had been critical of him./*~*/As would be expected, the administration’s actions were widely condemned by politicians and intelligence officials, but perhaps no condemnation was more damning than that of retired Navy admiral and commander of US Joint Special Operations Command, William H. McRaven, who wrote in the Washington Post , "I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency," adding, "Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation."/*~*/Still, at least there was some upside to the whole thing: The success of the original piece, even if written just to provoke a backlash and uproar, means we can perhaps expect more such stories in the near future./*~*/
