Content :Updated on August 16, 2018: We’ve refreshed the entire list for autumn, swapping a number of phones for newer models./*~*/It has a respectable mid-range processor and performance to match, and connects to any of Motorola’s many magnetic Moto Mods, which can add capabilities like speakers, a Hasselblad point-and-shoot camera, or even a photo printer to the back of the phone./*~*/Like other Z phones, there is no audio jack (thankfully, a USB-C adapter is included), Motorola’s cameras are decent, but not industry leading, and the glass back does add some fragility./*~*/It should cost hundreds more, but it’s been available at a very affordable price for nearly a year now, probably thanks to the release of its younger brother, the LG G7 ThinQ ./*~*/(Works on all four carriers) The Moto X4 ( 8/10 WIRED Recommends ) is the perfect example of an Android phone that has it where it counts, with some mild compromises to keep costs down./*~*/You will get an occasional dash of lag from the Android operating system, but its slowdowns are predictable and far less annoying than most phones at this price./*~*/The Nokia 6.1 is possibly the most sturdy, best-built phone at its price point, with a solid metal frame with sleek orange accents./*~*/(Works on all four carriers) Motorola’s G phones kickstarted the wave of affordable, decent smartphones several years back and the Moto G6 ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ) continues that trend./*~*/I still prefer iPhone to most Android devices because of its stability, app selection, and camera quality, among other reasons./*~*/Both the iPhone 6S/SE are also fine, but be aware that both are getting a bit old even if iOS 12 is set to give them a little performance boost later this year./*~*/
