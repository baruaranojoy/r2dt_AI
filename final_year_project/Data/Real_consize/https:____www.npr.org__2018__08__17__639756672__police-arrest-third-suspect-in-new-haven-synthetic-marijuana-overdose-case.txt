A third man has been arrested in connection with a toxic batch of synthetic marijuana, called K2, that led to more than 100 overdoses between Tuesday and Thursday night in New Haven, Conn., according to officials./*~*/New Haven Police Chief Anthony Campbell made the announcement at a news conference on Friday morning, describing the latest suspect as a man with "a history" with the department./*~*/Campbell also released the results of tests indicating that the K2 causing the rash of overdoses had been laced with a substance called fubinaca./*~*/"The overdoses started late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning in the historic New Haven Green, the city park that lies in the shadow of Yale University./*~*/Officers arrested John Parker, 53, and Felix Melendez, 37, on Wednesday afternoon after they had each been identified by overdose victims who claimed the men had been distributing the drug at the park, The Associated Press reported./*~*/The Hartford Courant reported court records show there was a warrant for Parker's arrest for allegedly selling K2 at the green in February./*~*/When police showed up at his house to charge him in the latest string of overdoses, his roommate opened the door, the newspaper reported, going on to note:/*~*/Police officers found a packet of K2 in Melendez's pocket, small amounts elsewhere in the apartment, and a batch of empty plastic bags that are commonly used to package K2, according to the court records."/*~*/Dr. Sandy Bogucki, emergency medicine specialist for Yale-New Haven Hospital, told the Courant the batch of K2 was rapid, but short acting version of the drug./*~*/Campbell told reporters one of the downsides of short-term effects of the drug is that many of the people treated at the hospital returned the the park for another high./*~*/
