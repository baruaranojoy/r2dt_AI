Julian Dunkerton says Brexit would have prevented Superdry from becoming a success
One of the co-founders of the fashion label Superdry has donated Â£1m to the campaign for another EU referendum./*~*/Multi-millionaire Julian Dunkerton said he was backing the People's Vote campaign because "we have a genuine chance to turn this around"./*~*/The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016./*~*/The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year./*~*/Mr Dunkerton said he believes his brand, which he left earlier this year, "would never have become the global success that it did" if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier./*~*/His donation, the largest received by the People's Vote, will go towards funding opinion polls./*~*/He added: "I will be paying for one of the most detailed polling exercises ever undertaken by a campaign so that more and more people have the confidence to demand the democratic right for their voice to be heard."/*~*/The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October./*~*/They have organised a number of events over the summer to step up pressure on MPs./*~*/Hundreds of people attended a rally in Edinburgh's Festival Square on Saturday in support of the campaign./*~*/
