The former Labour MP Jim Sheridan has been suspended from the party after saying he had lost “respect and empathy” for the Jewish community over the party’s antisemitism row, it is understood./*~*/Sheridan had been criticised for a social media post where he suggested that Jewish Labour members were acting in concert with “Blairite plotters” to undermine the leadership./*~*/“For almost all my adult life I have had the utmost respect and empathy for the Jewish community and their historic suffering,” he wrote on Facebook./*~*/“No longer due to what they and their Blairite plotters are doing to my party and the long suffering people of Britain who need a radical Labour government.”/*~*/A Labour party spokesman said: “The Labour party takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms./*~*/“All complaints about antisemitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”/*~*/The Labour party’s complaints procedure is confidential and therefore it was not able to provide official confirmation./*~*/Sources close to the party, however, confirmed that Sheridan had been suspended./*~*/
