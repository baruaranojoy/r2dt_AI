Content :Over the last three years, the PLA has rapidly expanded its overwater bomber operating areas, gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against U.S. and allied targets./*~*/The PLA may continue to extend its operations beyond the first island chain, demonstrating the capability to strike U.S. and allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean, including Guam./*~*/China uses an opportunistically timed progression of incremental but intensifying steps to attempt to increase effective control over disputed areas and avoid escalation to military conflict./*~*/The PAFMM unit operating in the South China Sea is paid salaries independent of any clear commercial fishing responsibilities and recruited from recently separated veterans./*~*/This appears to be similar to China’s practice of establishing large communities of Chinese students or workers in other countries, keeping them under the control of Beijing’s international coercive propaganda agency, the “United Front Work Department” (UFWD)./*~*/The report says that “One of the overarching goals of the structural reforms now reshaping the PLA is to construct a military capable of conducting complex joint operations, including those that would be involved in a Taiwan contingency.”/*~*/China might use a variety of disruptive, punitive, or lethal military actions in a limited campaign against Taiwan, probably in conjunction with overt and clandestine economic and political activities./*~*/The objective would be to break through or circumvent shore defenses, establish and build a beachhead, transport personnel and materiel to designated landing sites in the north or south of Taiwan’s western coastline, and launch attacks to seize and to occupy key targets or the entire island./*~*/As regular readers know, Generational Dynamics predicts that there is an approaching Clash of Civilizations world war, pitting the “axis” of China, Pakistan and the Sunni Muslim countries against the “allies,” the U.S., India, Russia, and Iran./*~*/KEYS: Generational Dynamics, China, Peoples Liberation Army, PLA, South China Sea, Freedom of Navigation Operations, FONOs, Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, PAFMM, United Front Work Department, UFWD, Magic Weapons, Adolf Hitler, Sir Winston Churchill, Taiwan Permanent web link to this article Receive daily World View columns by e-mail/*~*/
