Content :First, CNN obtained a recording of a conversation between Cohen and Trump from 2016 discussing how they would buy the rights to a Playboy model's story about an alleged affair./*~*/Then, citing sources with knowledge of the situation, CNN reported that Cohen claimed Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer up dirt about Hillary Clinton to his campaign./*~*/As recently as a few weeks ago, however, Giuliani said, "I do not expect that Michael Cohen is going to lie," during an interview with CNN's Dana Bash in response to a question about whether he thought Cohen will flip./*~*/He similarly told ABC News in early July, "I have no concerns that Michael Cohen is going to do anything but tell the truth."/*~*/In April, Trump said in a tweet that Cohen is "a fine person ... who I have always liked & respected."/*~*/But after the release of the Trump-Cohen recording, Trump criticized his former attorney, saying on Wednesday, "What kind of a lawyer would tape a client?/*~*/"Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam," the President tweeted./*~*/Jay Goldberg, another former Trump lawyer, argued Friday on CNN's "Erin Burnett Out Front" that Giuliani "immeasurably" damaged his case against Cohen with the sudden shift in tone./*~*/That's a stark reversal from what Giuliani once said about Cohen, whom he described as truthful not long ago./*~*/The criticism Giuliani is now leveling at Cohen follows a series of reports that have led the President to lash out at his former lawyer./*~*/
