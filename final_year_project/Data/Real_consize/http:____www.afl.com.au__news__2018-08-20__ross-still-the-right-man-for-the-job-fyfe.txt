Content :FREMANTLE captain Nat Fyfe is adamant Ross Lyon is still the right man to coach the club, but he can't promise there won't be more tough times ahead./*~*/Brownlow medallist Brad Hardie says Lyon and chief executive Steve Rosich should be the first ones out the door in the wake of last week's 133-point loss to Geelong./*~*/The Cats booted an AFL record 23 straight goals during Fremantle's biggest ever defeat, and Dockers fans have been quick to vent their anger at Lyon./*~*/Although Fremantle has managed eight wins this season, the Dockers have lost nine games by 50 points or more./*~*/Lyon has two more years to run on his contract, but Hardie says it would be better for Fremantle to count their losses and pay him out now./*~*/"Make no mistake, this is a crisis and Lyon and Fremantle chief executive Steve Rosich (his biggest supporter) should be the first ones out the door," Hardie wrote on PerthNow ./*~*/"It's time the Fremantle board got serious about things and put the heat on a coach who has worn out his welcome, has completely coached the flair out of his playing group and, based on Saturday's post-match press conference, is either delusional or thinks he's above being questioned."/*~*/Fremantle is nearing the end of the third year of its rebuild and Fyfe said it was important for the club to stick by Lyon and Rosich./*~*/"In 2015 when we had senior players, the Ross Lyon we saw was a hard taskmaster," Fyfe said ahead of Saturday's clash with Collingwood in Perth./*~*/"At the moment, we're getting a version of Ross who is building relationships, educating young players, and committing to a strategy which means we're going to lose games of footy at times./*~*/
