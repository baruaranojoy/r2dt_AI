Content :Like many researchers, Bai uses Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, where individuals sign up to complete simple tasks, such as taking surveys for academics or marketers, and earn a low fee./*~*/On Tuesday, August 7, he posed a simple question in a Facebook group for psychology researchers: "Have anyone used Mturk in the last few weeks and notice any quality drop?"/*~*/As he would later elaborate in a blog post , Bai had found that the surveys he conducted with MTurk were full of nonsense answers to open-ended questions and respondents with duplicate GPS locations./*~*/Kathryn Johnson, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, spent the past week going back over her data to see if what Bai reported on his blog was true for her research./*~*/A bunch of researchers told Bai that they had repeated instances of survey respondents replying “nice” or “good” to open-ended questions for which those words made no sense./*~*/It’s not necessarily nefarious or evil, but there is a gray area,” says Reid Tatoris, vice president of product outreach and marketing at Distil, which detects and protects clients from automated attacks and bots./*~*/In response to this week’s bot worries, a representative for Amazon told WIRED that the company suspends or terminates anyone found completing MTurk tasks by automated means./*~*/“There are a dozen people I know of personally who run bots, and they get away with it,” she says, adding that it would take her 30 seconds to write a simple script to fill in survey information automatically on MTurk./*~*/Members of the Facebook group where Bai originally posted about MTurk say they’ve reached out to Amazon this week, but do not report hearing back./*~*/Last week, Bai created a questionnaire for researchers—not on MTurk—and is now leading a crowdsourced effort among social scientists to figure out how much of the bad data he has seen is new, how large the problem is, and how to stop it./*~*/
