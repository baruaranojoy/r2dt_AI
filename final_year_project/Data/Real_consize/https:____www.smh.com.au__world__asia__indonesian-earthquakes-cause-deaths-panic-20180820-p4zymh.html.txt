Content :A shallow magnitude 6.9 quake that hit about 10pm on Sunday was one of several powerful earthquakes in the north-east of Lombok that also caused landslides./*~*/Photo: AP At last 11 people on Lombok and neighbouring Sumbawa island were killed by collapsing buildings or heart attacks, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said on Monday./*~*/“Many people were staying outside their houses or were at refugee shelters when the earthquake struck so it didn’t cause many lives,” Nugroho said./*~*/The swarm of quakes caused panic in Sembalun subdistrict on Lombok in the shadow of Mount Rinjani, but many people were already staying in tents following the deadly jolt in early August and its hundreds of aftershocks./*~*/Dwikorita Karnawatim, who heads Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, said buildings that hadn't collapsed so far had suffered repeated stress, and authorities had urged people to avoid both the mountain's slopes and weakened buildings./*~*/Sunday night's tremor occurred on a different fault and was not an aftershock of the magnitude 7.0 quake on August 5 that killed 460 people, damaged tens of thousands of homes and displaced several hundred thousand people./*~*/The quake lasting five to 10 seconds also was felt in the neighbouring island of Bali and as far away as East Java and Makassar in Sulawesi./*~*/Video shot by the Indonesian Red Cross showed huge clouds of dust billowing from the mountain's slopes./*~*/Rinjani has been closed to visitors following a July earthquake that killed 16 people, triggered landslides and stranded hundreds of tourists on the mountain./*~*/To donate: Australian Red Cross Indonesian Earthquakes Appeal www redcross.org.au/*~*/
