The report was released on the website of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI)./*~*/This is being managed despite the pernicious legacy of massive NPAs, de-leveraging of commercial bank credit and an uncertain global trade environment.”/*~*/As per the old series (2004-05), the expansion in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices was 9.57 per cent during 2006-07, when Manmohan Singh was prime minister./*~*/"The UPA also delivered the ONLY instance of double digit annual growth in modern Indian history," it said./*~*/The National Statistics Commission had set up the Committee to recommend suitable measures to strengthen systems and processes for collection, collation and dissemination of these statistics with possibility for improving timeliness./*~*/Pictures From Priyanka Chopra & Nick Jonas' Roka Ceremony/*~*/
