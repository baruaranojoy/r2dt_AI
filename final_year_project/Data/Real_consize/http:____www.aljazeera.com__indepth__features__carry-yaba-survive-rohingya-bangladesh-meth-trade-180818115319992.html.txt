Content :Use of the drug has risen at an alarming rate, with authorities struggling to stem the flow of tens of millions of pills pouring in from Myanmar - where they're manufactured - and ripping through Bangladesh's cities and villages./*~*/"At the beginning of the influx, we couldn't search every Rohingya man for possession because of the miserable conditions of the camps," said Md Saiful Hasan, senior assistant to the special commissioner of Cox's Bazar's district./*~*/A. is a carrier of yaba, receiving 5,000 Bangladeshi Taka ($60) for every 1,000 pills he manages to move from Kutupalong camp to Cox's Bazar, a popular tourist destination 40km away./*~*/In October 2016 , A., his mother, wife and three sons fled to Bangladesh, taking only a few clothing items with them - like many others from the long-persecuted, mostly Muslim, minority did before and after them in their bid to escape the violent campaigns against them in Myanmar's Rakhine state./*~*/Despite having lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist Myanmar, the Rohingya are not considered one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups and have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless./*~*/Upon arriving in the Ukhiya upazila (sub-district) almost two years ago, A. and his family were prevented from entering Kutupalong camp by the Bangladeshi soldiers manning its entrances./*~*/According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, yaba was first introduced to East Asia during World War II to boost the performance of troops./*~*/Since then, the strong stimulant has grown in popularity across the region, including in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar, where Bangladeshi authorities believe there are more than 50 drug factories./*~*/"The yaba trend has increased in Cox's Bazar, but law enforcement agencies are working on a 24/7 basis on this issue," Hasan, the assistant SP, said./*~*/But in dry spells, I don't earn any money," he said, adding that the proceeds are spent on paying back loans, grocery shopping and health expenses./*~*/
