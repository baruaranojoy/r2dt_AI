Smoke from the Ferguson Fire has been drifting over Yosemite National Park
A huge, deadly wildfire that burned for weeks and threatened the Yosemite National Park in California has finally been contained./*~*/The Ferguson Fire has burned through nearly 97,000 acres (39,250 hectares) of land to the south-west of the park since 13 July./*~*/Their closure, mainly due to smoke blowing into the park, damaged the local economy during peak tourist season./*~*/The Ferguson Fire is one of several wildfires that have raged across California in recent weeks./*~*/But cooler weather and calmer winds have helped give fire crews the upper hand, officials said./*~*/The centre of the national park has reopened after being shut for three weeks although lingering smoke meant a few main roads remained closed over the weekend./*~*/Park officials urged visitors to exercise caution, warning that sporadic fires still burned within containment lines./*~*/Elsewhere in the state, the Mendocino Complex fire west of Sacramento is now 76% contained, authorities said./*~*/Further north, the Carr Fire, which has killed at least seven people, is now 83% contained according to officials./*~*/Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
