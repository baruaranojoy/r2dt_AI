Content :Seeing people I generally like and agree with subtweeting and attacking others—on top of the world's perpetually bleak news—has begun to gnaw away at my mental health and spiritual wellbeing./*~*/Today's Twitter calls to mind the plot of Ghostbusters 2 : It's a digital sewer of negativity slime we're all wading through ./*~*/With the company's fortunes tied directly to user count, there's little incentive to purge bad actors or even those who break Twitter's own rules, especially if they're famous enough./*~*/Some who saw 2017’s mini Twitter exodus happening dismissed it as a passing fad, while others dissed Mastodon as a dead-end social network doomed to extinction just like its eponymous megafauna./*~*/But the thing is, as long as administrators are paying to maintain their instances, Mastodon can expand or contract naturally without threatening the entire network./*~*/If anything, Twitter's made its elegant platform significantly worse over the last few years, changing the "favorite" icon , introducing a higher character count , pushing obnoxious "suggestions," and messing up the chronological timeline in favor of an algorithmically-generated one ./*~*/The wider federated network has posts in English, Japanese, Spanish, and from techy open source enthusiasts./*~*/Sex workers exiled from other social media have even made their home on a Mastodon instance./*~*/It's even simple to contribute descriptions of images you're posting for the visually impaired, something Twitter doesn't bother turning on by default./*~*/After years of feeling anxious and unhappy checking my tweets and keeping up my personal brand , it’s like I’ve moved to a new town where nobody knows me, but everyone is looking to make new friends./*~*/
