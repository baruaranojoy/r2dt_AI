Content :Ipswich City Council has had its final meeting before the Queensland government sacks it./*~*/The government will on Tuesday introduce laws to sack the entire council and appoint administrators after a corruption probe saw 15 people, including two former mayors, charged with 86 offences./*~*/The move eliminates any ability for council to appeal the decision, meaning administrators will definitely take over the running of council business until the next local government election in 2020./*~*/The remaining 10 councillors who aren't facing any allegations all gave valedictory speeches on Monday, with veteran councillor Paul Tully reporting there "wasn't a dry eye in the house"./*~*/"My parting comments were that I would still walk tall and proudly along the streets of Ipswich for what I've done and achieved over the last four decades," Cr Tully said./*~*/A number of the councillors, in particular David Pahlke and acting Mayor Wayne Wendt, took aim at the state government for its decision to sack the council./*~*/However Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was unmoved, saying it was a necessary decision./*~*/"But we won't sit idly by, we'll make sure this is cleaned up, the residents (of Ipswich) can see an end to this and the whole thing can move on."/*~*/More than a hundred people packed into the public gallery of the modestly sized council chamber to watch the final meeting./*~*/Cr Tully said he would "probably" try to re-enter council in 2020, and expected some of his colleagues to do the same./*~*/
