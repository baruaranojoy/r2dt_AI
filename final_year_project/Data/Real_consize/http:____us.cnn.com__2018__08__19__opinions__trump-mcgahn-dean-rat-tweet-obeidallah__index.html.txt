Content :Because Trump values loyalty to him above all else -- including any responsibilities that civil servants like McGahn may have to the American people or White House./*~*/Indeed, this loyalty principle -- and invoking the term "rat" -- eerily recall the motif of crime bosses./*~*/Former Mafia kingpin John Gotti used that word "rat" to describe his former associate Sammy "the Bull" Gravano, who had testified against him./*~*/Well, Dean played a crucial role in helping both Congress and Watergate prosecutors understand the full scope of the criminal conspiracy involving Nixon and his top aides surrounding the break-in to the Democratic National headquarters and the cover-up that followed./*~*/Dean later testified in the federal trial against former Nixon officials involved in the Watergate cover-up that led to the conviction of several, including former US Attorney General John Mitchell./*~*/Consequently, Dean pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice in exchange for the government not pursuing additional charges against him./*~*/At the time of his guilty plea, Dean noted he could have escaped conviction on "legal technicalities" but remarked that would have been a "shallow victory."/*~*/It simply confirms that he acts and sounds like a crime boss, clarifying for all involved the lens he's using to assess their actions./*~*/So why would Trump reach for such an ominous term to characterize the way (in his view) the Times piece described McGahn's motivation?/*~*/Whatever Trump's reasons, it's striking how effectively the word "rat" telegraphs the choices available to someone, like McGahn, who cooperates with the special counsel -- even with the President's assent, as he points out./*~*/
