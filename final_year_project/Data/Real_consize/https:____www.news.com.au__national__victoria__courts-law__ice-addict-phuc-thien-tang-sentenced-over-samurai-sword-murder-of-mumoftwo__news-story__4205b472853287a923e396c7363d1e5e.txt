Content :IN A rage and high on the drug ice, a Vietnamese refugee squatting in the sun room of an unoccupied Melbourne home lashed out wildly./*~*/He asked her to “stop nagging” and “shut up” before grabbing hold of a metal vacuum cleaner pole and beating her to death with it./*~*/She lashed Tang, labelling him a “coward” for failing to help his victim, for leaving her to be discovered three days later in a room covered with blood and for taking her ANZ debit card and trying in vain to withdraw $60 from an ATM./*~*/Tang, dressed in black pants and a grey jumper and with his hair cropped short, did not speak when his sentence was handed down./*~*/Tang, the son of a South Vietnamese ranking officer who was killed during the Vietnam War, moved to Australia at the age of 15 to escape military service./*~*/After killing Ms Huynh, fleeing the scene and failing to withdraw money from a nearby ATM, Tang returned home./*~*/He took Ms Huynh’s purse and travelled to the Richmond area where he tossed her belongings in a garden and slept on the streets for 13 days before he was arrested./*~*/Police recovered from the scene Tang’s sword and a vacuum cleaner pole with “blood and strands of hair attached to it”./*~*/Pathologists found it difficult to ascertain the exact cause of death but did find the victim suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the left side of her face./*~*/“Each of them speak of missing the small, ordinary interactions with their mother and of a profound sadness that important future events in their lives will not be shared with her,” Ms Taylor said./*~*/
