Content :The investors betting against Tesla just got a gift from the company's chief executive, Elon Musk./*~*/Mr. Musk opened up on Thursday in an emotional interview with The New York Times about the toll the past year has taken on him, blaming those so-called short-sellers for much of his stress./*~*/It followed his cryptic tweet last week about converting the publicly traded company into a private one, which created a frenzy in the market./*~*/The slide in Tesla's shares generated more than $1 billion in profits for short-sellers, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm, which tracks the positions held by those investors./*~*/Mr. Musk had long sparred with investors who make money when the company's stock falls./*~*/Mr. Musk told The New York Times that he was expecting ''at least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla's destruction.''/*~*/In March, a driver was killed after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot, Tesla's driver-assistance feature, was in use./*~*/He even taunted David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund has performed poorly this year in part because of its short bet on Tesla./*~*/In the past decade, short-sellers have not held a position valued at more than $10 billion in any other American company for more than three months, according to IHS Markit./*~*/Even this year, amid all of Tesla's woes, betting on a decline in the company's share price has not been a winner./*~*/
