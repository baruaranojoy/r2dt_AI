Content :As the Turkish currency swoons, Erdogan has focused domestic anger instead against the United States and portrayed his country as the victim of intentional sabotage — shifting attention from economic problems that analysts said his government has failed for years to adequately address./*~*/These include a visit to Ankara by Russia’s foreign minister, a phone call between Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron, and a pledge by Qatar to invest $15 billion in the Turkish economy./*~*/But Erdogan’s ability to benefit from the crisis has raised questions about whether Trump underestimated the Turkish leader, a “nimble tactician” who is convinced that Western powers are bent on crippling Turkey because of its status as a strong Muslim nation, said Lisel Hintz, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies./*~*/Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife, Emine, greet supporters of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Ankara on Saturday./*~*/The tough U.S. measures, including the president’s “brash” tweets , seemed timed to undermine efforts by Erdogan and other Turkish officials to reassure the public and the markets, Hintz said./*~*/Turkish officials took pains to highlight Erdogan’s telephone calls last week in the middle of the crisis with Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel./*~*/“Before it is too late, Washington must give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives,” Erdogan wrote in an Aug. 10 op-ed published in the New York Times./*~*/“What he is doing is trying to cover up his failure in the economy by portraying the Brunson affair as a pretext to the currency crisis,” Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, said last week./*~*/Turkey is also prosecuting half a dozen American citizens in addition to Brunson on what U.S. officials say are political charges, along with three Turkish employees of the U.S. mission in the country./*~*/Trump appeared to publicly acknowledge an element of that deal on Thursday when he said that “we got somebody out for him,” a reference to efforts on Erdogan’s behalf to win the release of a Turkish citizen held by Israel./*~*/
