Content :Social media, too, is inundated with people criticising the BJP-led central government for not taking the calamity in the southern state seriously./*~*/Union home minister Rajnath Singh had earlier announced Rs 100 crore aid for the flood-hit state./*~*/"Dear prime minister, please declare Kerala floods a national disaster without any delay./*~*/As per the Disaster Management Act, 2005 , “disaster” means a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man-made causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area./*~*/In reply to a question in the Parliament during the recently-concluded Monsoon Session, Minister of State (Home) Kiren Rijiju said, "The existing guidelines of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), do not contemplate declaring a disaster as a ‘national calamity’.” And in March 2001, the then MoS (Agriculture) Shripad Naik had told the Parliament that the government had termed the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the super cyclone in Odisha in 1999 as “a calamity of unprecedented severity”, The Indian Express reported ./*~*/Hence, in the absence of a provision which necessitates for a big calamity to be termed as national disaster, the growing clamour for it be called so, is vague and only drives away from the larger issue of rehabilitation and rebuilding which lies in front of the state, now that the rescue work is nearing completion./*~*/Central government officials have said that declaring Kerala floods as a 'national disaster' on paper is not going to help the state any more than what is already being extended to it in terms of financial aid and deployment of relief and rescue forces on the ground./*~*/“As compared to the US, we have a better system in place since there is no need for a government notification to move central forces like the Army or the NDRF to assist states for disaster relief and rescue work./*~*/Kerala floods: As toll since 29 May climbs to 357, IMD says rainfall intensity in state will reduce from 20 August/*~*/Kerala floods LIVE updates: IMD says no heavy rain warning for next four days; 22,034 more rescued today/*~*/
