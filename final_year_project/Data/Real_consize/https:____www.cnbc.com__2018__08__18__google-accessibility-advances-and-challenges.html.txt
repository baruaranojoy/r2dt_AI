Content :A group of Google employees, including Allen (center), prepare to give product demonstrations at an Assistive Technology Industry Association conference/*~*/Homework is a drag for any high schooler, but for the class of 2006's Laura Palmaro Allen, even starting an assignment required a laborious, multistep process./*~*/She and her family had to strip her textbooks from their bindings, run the pages through a high speed scanner, and digitize them — all before she could use text-to-speech software to actually ingest her history lesson or reading exercise./*~*/Allen has limited vision because of a rare eye condition called Choroidal Osteomas : At the time, her school didn't offer any easier ways to accommodate her./*~*/As a program manager for accessibility for Google 's Chrome software, she not only gives demos, but spends her days making the company's products work better for people with all different kinds of disabilities./*~*/Over the past several years, the tech industry generally — and Google specifically — have been more deliberate about baking accessibility into products, and beefing up overall resources for the roughly one billion people worldwide with some form of disability./*~*/While there's still considerable work to do on existing products, Google sees its next big challenge as exploring how it can use its technology to help make the the wider world — not just the bits and bytes of digital screens — more accessible./*~*/For example , the ChromeVox screen reader and adjustable magnification and contrast settings aid visually impaired users, and there's a keyboard guide for people who can't use a mouse./*~*/Outside the Googleplex While Google works to improve its own products and processes and launch into new domains, the Accessibility team has also ramped up its external focus./*~*/That includes small tweaks, like putting braille labels on the food in its micro-kitchens, or wider initiatives, like guiding managers on how to make every presentation accessible./*~*/
