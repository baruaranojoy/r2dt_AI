Content :Trump, in a series of angry tweets, denounced a New York Times story that his White House counsel, Don McGahn, had been cooperating extensively with the special counsel team investigating Russian election meddling and potential collusion with Trump's Republican campaign./*~*/"The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel [sic] Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel [sic], he must be a John Dean type 'RAT'," Trump wrote, misspelling the word "counsel"./*~*/Dean, a frequent critic of the president, was the White House counsel for Nixon during the Watergate scandal./*~*/He ultimately cooperated with prosecutors and helped bring down the Nixon presidency in 1974, though he served a prison term for obstruction of justice./*~*/Dean tweeted on Sunday (AEST) in response to the Times story: "Trump, a total incompetent, is bungling and botching his handling of Russiagate./*~*/He added on Monday (AEST) in response to Trump's tweets that he doubts the president has "ANY IDEA what McGahn has told Mueller./*~*/Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said in an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump didn't raise executive privilege or attorney-client privilege during those interviews because his team believed - he says now, wrongly - that fully participating would be the fastest way to bring the investigation to a close./*~*/Trump on Sunday continued to rail against the Mueller investigation, which he has labelled a "witch hunt."/*~*/Trump tweeted, referencing the indiscriminate and damaging allegations made by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to expose communists./*~*/Giuliani also tried to make the case that having Trump sit down for an interview with Mueller's team wouldn't accomplish much because of the he-said-she-said nature of witnesses' recollections./*~*/
