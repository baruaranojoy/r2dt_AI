Content :A man who infiltrated the Bandidos bikie gang has become the first known refugee from Australia after an overseas tribunal found he was abandoned by local authorities who blew his cover./*~*/Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) accepted evidence that there were murder contracts placed on Mr Utah's life after he was recruited by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) for a national operation against bikie gangs./*~*/In a ruling that condemned the actions of Australian authorities, the IRB found the country failed to offer Mr Utah adequate protection amid a "broader pattern due to corruption, ineptitude and structural difficulties"./*~*/The former soldier, who gave authorities information on serious crimes including murder, was a "significant target for the [Bandidos] leadership given his depth of knowledge and history with them and his subsequent betrayal", the IRB said./*~*/His role with the ACC included leading investigators to the body of Victorian man Earl Mooring four years after his murder, which Mr Utah said he witnessed./*~*/In a written judgment obtained by the ABC, IRB member Jodie Schmalzbauer found Mr Utah "established with 'clear and convincing evidence' the state's inability to provide operational adequate protection from the threat against him"./*~*/Former detective Duncan McNab, who wrote a book about Mr Utah and gave evidence in the IRB hearing, said it was an extraordinary twist to a policing scandal that should never have happened./*~*/The ACC, who paid Mr Utah as a registered agent and gave him certain legal immunity while he operated inside the Bandidos, removed him from "protective custody" after his cover was blown./*~*/She said Mr Utah's lawyer in Australia, Chris Hannay, had exhausted all options by approaching agencies, including Queensland Police, that had "jurisdiction to provide the claimant protective custody given the nature of his evidence in the murder that he witnessed"./*~*/Neither the ACC's successor, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC), nor the Queensland Police Service (QPS) answered detailed questions from the ABC./*~*/
