Content :MUMBAI: Indian media conglomerate Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) entered into a 3-year multi-layered partnership with telecom major Bharti Airtel within a week of removing all its content from Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Jio after a disagreement over price./*~*/“Airtel brings a huge consumer base, which today, potentially, is not even exposed to the OTT world or even some of the new age youth audience which is not available to TV.”/*~*/Goenka stressed that ZEE has managed to get a very significant deal for app-in-app integration at the cost-per-download level compared to retail price, apart from good minimum guarantees on the Airtel TV piece for providing content./*~*/Airtel will also share consumer insights and data of the users with ZEE as part of the deal./*~*/Goenka said that based on the demographic of Airtel TV consumers, ZEE will see which pieces of content are best fit for which platform./*~*/For Goenka, consumer data was very critical from a long-term partnership and it was one of the key negotiation points for the deal./*~*/“It is very critical in today’s time because that’s the way we will understand our consumers’ behaviour and how they are reacting to the content./*~*/Incidentally, none of this was part of the Reliance Jio deal, and Goenka thinks the company was not getting fair value for its content./*~*/ET first reported on August 8 that ZEE has removed all its content from Reliance Jio, including 35 live TV channels and more than 2 lakh hours of video-on-demand content after failing to arrive at an agreement on price./*~*/Gopal Vittal, MD — India & South Asia at Bharti Airtel said that the partnership is a natural fit./*~*/
