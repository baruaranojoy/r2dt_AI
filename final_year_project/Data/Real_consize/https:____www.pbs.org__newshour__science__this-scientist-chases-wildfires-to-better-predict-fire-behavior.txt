Content :On the heels of one of the most destructive wildfire seasons in California’s history, the state is once again beset by massive blazes that have burned down homes in some communities and threatened others./*~*/The Ranch firepart of the Mendocino Complex fire currently burning in northern California—is the largest wildfire in state history, having consumed more than 300,000 acres./*~*/It bested the record set just eight months ago by the Thomas fire near Los Angeles./*~*/In the face of such threats—exacerbated in part by climate change and development in fire-prone areas—experts want to improve predictions of wildfire behavior to make better use of limited firefighting resources./*~*/Craig Clements is at the forefront of efforts to gather information about fire weather to plug into models that simulate the fire–atmosphere interactions./*~*/In 2013 the San Jose State University meteorologist launched the Rapid Deployments to Wildfires Experiment (RaDFIRE) program (funded by the National Science Foundation), which deployed Doppler radars, LiDAR (which uses light pulses to generate three-dimensional images) and sensors on airplanes to gather information on winds and moisture around fires./*~*/This year his team has been helping sample smoke plumes from fires around the state, and he hopes to soon launch RaDFIRE 2, a more ambitious successor to the original program, which ended in 2016./*~*/Scientific American spoke with Clements about his efforts to capture fire weather to better understand wildfire behavior./*~*/These things have been studied in numerical simulations and also in laboratory experiments, but we really want to capture these in the real world./*~*/When there is a large wildfire, they bring in the fire behavior analyst and the incident meteorologist—and that meteorologist is there to forecast the conditions./*~*/
