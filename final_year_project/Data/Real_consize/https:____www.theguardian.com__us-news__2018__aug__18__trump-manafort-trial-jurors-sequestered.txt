Content :Addressing reporters on the south lawn at the White House, Trump said his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was “a very good person”./*~*/On Saturday, with the jury recessed for the weekend before an expected third day of deliberations on Monday, legal experts said it was highly uncharacteristic for a sitting president to weigh in on an ongoing trial, much less one involving a former aide./*~*/On the first day of testimony in court, the president tweeted that his former aide was being treated worse than Al Capone, the notorious 1920s gangster who was imprisoned on charges of tax evasion./*~*/The jury in Alexandria has received typical instructions not to read or watch the news but Judge TS Ellis chose not to sequester its members for the duration of the trial./*~*/The charges against Manafort do not concern Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, links between Trump aides and Moscow and potential obstruction of justice by the president./*~*/Sequestration of a jury, which is rare, is usually invoked when publicity surrounding a trial is especially high, in the aim of preventing any interference with juror objectivity./*~*/Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters
Bloch said that while it was unusual for a judge not to have sequestered the jury in such a high-profile case, it was difficult to fault Ellis without knowing how he shaped his decision./*~*/This week, Trump escalated his attacks by revoking the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, who has been a vocal critic./*~*/The White House initially said Trump’s decision was taken because Brennan had monetized his position and leaked classified information – claims not backed with evidence./*~*/“We have the president criticizing a case that was approved by people at Department of Justice who ultimately report to him,” he said, pointing out that both deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Christopher Wray would typically be briefed on developments in Mueller’s work./*~*/
