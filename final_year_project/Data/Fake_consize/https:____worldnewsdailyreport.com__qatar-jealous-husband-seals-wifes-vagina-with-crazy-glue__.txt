Content :The 33-year-old man was brought forth before the court after his wife was rushed off to the emergency room and suffered medical complications and excruciating pain./*~*/He confessed to the judge that he was guilty of gluing her genitals but only because he believed she had adulterous ideas after he found out she had liked a post of his 12-year-old cousin on Facebook./*~*/The man was brought before the court after accusations by the wife’s family of damaging her reproductive organs and risking to make her infertile./*~*/According to Judge Muhammad Bin Saden of the Qatari court of Justice in Doha, the husband did unjustly bring harm to his wife, although his reasons were “well-intentioned” but put into action in an “awkward way” he said./*~*/Also, the judge pointed out that, after going through the evidence and photos the husband had brought to court, the suffering was in part justified but still decided the woman should be administered 100 lashes as to prevent further “misunderstandings” between her and her husband./*~*/The husband was sentenced to pay 40 Riyal ($10 US dollars) and prevented to use any sort of glue or adhesive on his wife ever again./*~*/
