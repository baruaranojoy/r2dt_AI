Content :HOBSCROSS, BRITANNIA—Taking exception with the flashy, non-accidental opening in the Western wall of the thatched hut, the serf community expressed disapproval Monday after discovering that Ernault Bauldry, a hotshot peasant and laborer in Hobscross fields, has a window./*~*/“Well, la-di-dah, look who’s putting on airs with letting the sun and the wind into his hovel./*~*/‘Ooooh, I can see the midden from my hearth, me, on account of the window,’” said Auld Gonnar, 32, an aging swineherd of some local repute who is considering a second daubing of mud for his own hut’s leeward wall provided enough of his piglets live to autumn./*~*/“Well, congratulations, Ernault, just because you earn an extra penny or three each sixmonth, you’ve gone and let in all manner of demons and spirits of the air./*~*/Next, it’ll be fresh reeds in the thatch every St. Cumberthsday and a gaudy door that closes, you may depend on it, and bad cess to him, I say.” Ernault was not available for comment, having died that morning of an infected splinter received while cutting the window./*~*/From the Creators of The Simpsons, Disenchantment is now streaming on Netflix ./*~*/
