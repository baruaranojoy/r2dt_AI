Content :The stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones, as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World War./*~*/Alfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oder’s confluence with the Bóbr river on April 6, when they made an astonishing catch: a gigantic Wels catfish, measuring 12 feet (3.68 meters) and weighing 413 pounds (187.5 kg)./*~*/Among a large quantity of half-digested fish, they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany, as well dozens of human bone fragments./*~*/The examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties, who died many decades ago./*~*/Further analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s, and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer, killed during the occupation of Poland./*~*/The team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests, could not determine, however, if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animal./*~*/The stomach of the enormous catfish contained more than a dozen corroded bone fragments, mainly parts of a human neck and skull./*~*/With a possible total length up to 4 m (13 ft) and a maximum weight of over 400 kg (880 lb), it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeon./*~*/Individuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons, ducks, rats, cats and even dogs, on land./*~*/A report in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard on 5 August 2009, mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, in Hungary, under water./*~*/
