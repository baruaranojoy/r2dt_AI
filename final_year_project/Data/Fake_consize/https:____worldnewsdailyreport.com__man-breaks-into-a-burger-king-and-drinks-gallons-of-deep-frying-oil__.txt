Content :The Miami Police Department received a call for a break-in at a Burger King restaurant around 2 A.M. and some officers were on the site in a matter of minutes./*~*/Upon arriving at the restaurant, they found 510-lb Romeo Carter, chugging down oil directly from the deep fryers./*~*/The 41-year old man has already ingested dozens of gallons of cooking oil but was still drinking it with an apparently unquenchable thirst./*~*/He was arrested on the site and accused of burglary, criminal trespass, theft by unlawful taking and criminal mischief./*~*/Many officers of the Miami Police Department were still on the site this morning to gather evidence and complete the investigation./*~*/Mr. Carter was released on bail this afternoon, and he briefly met with the Miami Inquirer to explain his ordeal./*~*/Mr Carter faces a total of 35 years in jail, but heâ€™s already offered to pay for all the damage he caused and Burger King could possibly agree to a settlement and accept to drop the charges./*~*/If the charges are maintained, he is expected to appear at the Miami-Dade County courthouse on May 8./*~*/
