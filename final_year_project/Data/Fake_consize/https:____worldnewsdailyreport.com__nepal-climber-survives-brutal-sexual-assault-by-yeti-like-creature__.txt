Content :Jason Barclay, 28, was on a solo adventure across the Himalayas with his two local sherpas when he was attacked during the night by what he believed was a bear./*~*/The creature lashed through his tent and started to shove the half-asleep man around, who managed to stay still despite his fear./*~*/Barclay finally realized the creature was, in fact, not a bear when he came into direct eye contact with the beast./*~*/The creature then attempted some form of sexual interaction with him, involving humping and loud moaning, recalled the victim./*~*/Pushpa Deuba, one of the two sherpas accompanying Barclay, lies in critical condition after he came to Barclayâ€™s rescue by making loud noises with some pans and was briefly attacked by the creature./*~*/Although it was dark and the attack occurred at night, both sherpas believe it was a yeti and not a bear, as bears do not climb at those altitudes they explained to the Kathmandu Herald./*~*/Jason Barclay has also kept some specimen of the semen for scientific analysis but says no serious research group has shown any interest at the moment./*~*/Although yeti is believed to be a legendary creature of the Himalayan regions, hundreds of encounters are nonetheless reported to local authorities by mountain climbers each year./*~*/
