Content :This astonishing announcement is based on the conclusions of a study using a new type of medically supervised near-death experiences, that allow patients to be clinically dead for almost 20 minutes before being brought back to life./*~*/This controversial process that was repeated on 944 volunteers over that last four years, necessitates a complex mixture of drugs including epinephrine and dimethyltryptamine, destined to allow the body to survive the state of clinical death and the reanimation process without damage./*~*/The extremely long duration of the experience was only recently made possible by the development of a new cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) machine called the AutoPulse./*~*/This type of equipment has already been used over the last few years to reanimate people who had been dead for somewhere between 40 minutes to an hour./*~*/Near-death experiences have been hypothesized in various medical journals in the past, as having the characteristics of hallucinations, but Dr Ackermann and his team, on the contrary, consider them as evidence for the existence of the afterlife and of a form of dualism between mind and body./*~*/The team of scientists led by Dr. Berthold Ackermann has monitored the operations and have compiled the testimonies of the subjects./*~*/Although there are some slight variations from one individual to another, all of the subjects have some memories of their period of clinical death./*~*/The scientists say that they are well aware the many of their conclusions could shock a lot of people, like the fact that the religious beliefs of the various subjects seem to have held no incidence at all, on the sensations and experiences that they described at the end of the experiment./*~*/“I know our results could disturb the beliefs of many people,” says Mr Ackermann./*~*/“But in a way, we have just answered one of the greatest questions in the history of mankind, so I hope these people will be able to forgive us./*~*/
