Content :I'm Luis!/*~*/^-^ (@Zerquix18)/*~*/Facebook had a global outage today after a man hacked into their servers in order to bring back the beloved plane react, which Facebook removed two days ago because “it was a bug, not a feature”./*~*/“He man managed to break all security systems, but since he didn’t know how to control everything, when he attempted to bring the plane react back, he f*cked up, and caused a major outage”, Facebook sources confirm./*~*/Since the service went down immediately, Facebook engineers found out about what was happening and put the service backup./*~*/The person responsible for the hacking remains anonymous, but Facebook will start investigating as soon as they confirm the service is entirely up./*~*/
