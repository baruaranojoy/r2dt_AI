Content :The woman who was distracted while texting and driving had an accident with a car of a member of the royal Saudi family, whose name has not been disclosed, and could explain the harsh judgment, believe some experts./*~*/Judge Al-Manar explained during the trial that even though no one was harmed during the accident and that the car was barely scratched, it was important to “send a strong message to women drivers of the Kingdom.”/*~*/Saudi government-appointed psychiatrist Dr. Abdallah al-Fakah says women are considered more dangerous on the road because they lack the mental qualities men do to “stay in control” and “process their thoughts in a rational manner.”/*~*/“Women should not feel ashamed of this but should instead embrace their differences with men and stay at home and limit themselves to simple tasks such as cleaning and cooking,” he added during the interview./*~*/Although Saudi Arabia has overturned last June a decades-long edict banning women from driving, penalties for women drivers are ten to fifty times harsher for women drivers who are believed to be more dangerous on the road than men by Saudi authorities./*~*/
