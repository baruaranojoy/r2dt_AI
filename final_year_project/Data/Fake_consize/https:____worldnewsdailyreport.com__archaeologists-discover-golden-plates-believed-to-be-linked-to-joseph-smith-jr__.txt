Content :The scientists, led by Professor Abraham Jones, are associated with the Brigham Young University’s faculty of archaeology./*~*/They were using advanced metal detectors, lasers and other ground-penetrating imaging technology to look for underground structures when they noticed a small cave-like cavity./*~*/They dug up the entrance, which was buried under a dozen feet of rocks and dirt, and explored the very exiguous cavern./*~*/The walls and ceiling were covered with ancient traces of soot, presumably from torches, suggesting the cave had been visited many times in the past./*~*/On top of a large flat stone resembling an altar, they found what looks like a book made of metal plates./*~*/The plates are covered with mysterious symbols, very similar to the “reformed Egyptian” characters, written by Joseph Smith Jr. on the document known as the “Anthon Transcript”./*~*/Joseph Smith Jr. is said to have found similar golden plates on September 22, 1823, in a hill near his home in Manchester, New York./*~*/He claimed that an angel named Moroni had directed him to a buried stone box, containing a set of gold plates, covered with strange symbols./*~*/This new discovery could be the most important material and historical proof ever found, to back the claims of Joseph Smith Jr./*~*/Professor Jones and the scientists from Brigham Young University will now perform an extensive series of tests and analysis to determine if the plates could indeed be linked to the prophet./*~*/
