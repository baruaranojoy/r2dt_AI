Content :Helmut Grolsch, 46, allegedly attempted to insert his genitals inside the shell of what doctors believe to be a cone snail, a large-sized extremely venomous predatory sea snail very common in the region./*~*/Grolsch apparently inserted his genitals inside the shell not knowing that cone snails can deliver a lethal dose of venom which is powerful enough to kill humans and can provoke symptoms such as paralysis, extreme pain and dizziness./*~*/Grolsch admittedly was intoxicated by alcohol and under the influence of several drugs when the incident occurred./*~*/Helmut Grolsch was transported to Phuket International Hospital in excruciating pain and half paralyzed after the large-sized snail delivered a lethal dose of venom to the man’s genitalia./*~*/Dr. Paribatra at Bangkok Hospital Phuket says that the cone nail had severely damaged his patient’s urethra but that his patient should still be able to urinate using a straw-like apparatus./*~*/Cone snails are known to use their extremely sharp spines to harpoon small fish with the ability to penetrate even gloves and wetsuits./*~*/Thirty deaths have been recorded in Thailand since 2006 as a result of accidental harpooning in humans who either handled the creatures or stepped on the shells while wading./*~*/
