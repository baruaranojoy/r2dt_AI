Content :The young man, who had converted to Islam in 2014, had pledged allegiance to ISIS hoping to become a full-fledged soldier in its war against Western civilization./*~*/Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape./*~*/“I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me,” he told reporters, visibly ashamed./*~*/“Upon my arrival, they kept pinching my ass, rubbing my nipples across my shirt and whistling at me,” he said./*~*/A picture of Hermann Gottlieb upon his arrival in Syria in 2015, days before he was literally transformed into an ISIS sex slave./*~*/Hermann Gottlieb, 28, says he was drugged the first week upon his arrival and woke up chained to a bed where he would spend most of his eighteen months of captivity./*~*/One of the commanders had a fetish for Marilyn Monroe and would even make me watch movies of her so I would talk like her,” he told reporters./*~*/“One commander told me I was doing Allah’s work and that ISIS soldiers respected me and appreciated my services and that I was more valuable to them chained to this bed than in the line of fire,” he told reporters./*~*/“Once, I must’ve sucked at least twenty dicks and got sodomized by maybe 40 guys in the same day after a major ISIS victory,” he recalled in horror./*~*/Hermann Gottlieb was released last month from his captivity by a high commander who had grown fond of him and eventually was able to reach the border of Iraq where he was eventually rescued by Iraqi forces and transferred to Germany where he is presently detained and under investigation./*~*/
