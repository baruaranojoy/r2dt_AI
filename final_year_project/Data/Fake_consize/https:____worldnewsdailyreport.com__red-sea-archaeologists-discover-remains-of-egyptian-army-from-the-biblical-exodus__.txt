Content :The scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor./*~*/The remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters./*~*/They estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site./*~*/It was discovered near the remains of a richly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman./*~*/Many clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus./*~*/First of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area./*~*/The sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted./*~*/This new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten./*~*/For centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical./*~*/A lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered./*~*/
