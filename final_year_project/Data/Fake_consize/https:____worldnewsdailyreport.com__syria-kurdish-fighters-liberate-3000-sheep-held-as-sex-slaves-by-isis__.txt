Content :The Peshmerga General Command (PGC) has announced this morning that their fighters had liberated three villages previously controlled by ISIS during a ground assault supported by U.S. air strikes./*~*/In one of the villages, they found an “animal brothel” operated by the terrorist group, in which nearly 4000 sheep and goats were used as sex slaves./*~*/PCG Commander, Col. Hemin Hassan, described the horrible conditions in which the animals were detained and abused./*~*/According to some civilians who were forced to work in the brothel, some animals were forced to engage in sexual intercourse with more than 100 ISIS fighters per day./*~*/The animals will now be transported inside Kurdish controlled regions of Syria and be distributed among families of dead Peshmerga fighters./*~*/The Peshmerga General Command held a press conference just outside the village before inviting the media to visit the alleged brothel./*~*/This isn’t the first time that the Islamic State is linked to bestiality, but it is the first official and operational “animal brothel” linked to the organization to be liberated./*~*/Other suspected animal brothels were found in the liberated cities of Raqqa and Palmyra, but the animals had already been taken to other cities by the Islamists./*~*/Animal Rights organizations estimate that 80,000 to 150,000 animals are currently used as sex slaves in ISIS operated brothels./*~*/The vast majority of these animals are sheep and goats, but some cases involving cows and chickens have also been reported./*~*/
