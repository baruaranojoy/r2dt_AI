Content :A new study reveals teen pregnancy rates drop significantly after age 19./*~*/The startling correlation was reported by millions of family planning centers nationwide after a 5 years study conducted by an exclusive research team led by Dr. Sandra McKinnon./*~*/Dr. Sandra McKinnon reported the team’s findings during a recent US Reproductive Studies Symposium./*~*/“It is an undisputed fact that teen pregnancy rates are nearly non-existent when a woman reaches the age of 20./*~*/If you encourage your adolescents to abstain from sexual intercourse until they reach this age, the chances of them becoming teen mothers are incredibly slim–Almost nonexistent./*~*/“While the parents are concerned with protecting their young daughters from badly-timed pregnancies, we’re concerned with finding the correlation between the age of 20, and it’s effect on teen pregnancy.”/*~*/Dr. McKinnons findings were hailed as “groundbreaking and revolutionary” by senior researchers who have been attempting to find ways to reduce teen pregnancy rates for 30 years./*~*/“I think these studies will empower young women to avoid early motherhood so that they can develop their lives and careers prior to making the choice to get pregnant.”/*~*/Shelly Keaton, mother of 9 children had her first child at age 18./*~*/You could easily end up with a litter of children who you’re simply unable to support./*~*/
