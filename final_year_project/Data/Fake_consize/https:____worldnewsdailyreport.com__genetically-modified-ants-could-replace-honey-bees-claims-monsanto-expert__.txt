Content :The $3 million dollar grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has led the team of researchers at Monsanto to develop alternative strategies to “survive” an eventual honey bee Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a phenomenon that has been increasing in the past decade and that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear, a situation that could “dramatically impact the world’s food supply”, admit experts./*~*/John Leere, head biochemist at Monsanto, believes a genetically modified ant could eventually replace bees, in case of a total collapse of the species/*~*/The team of researchers has developed a genetically modified ant that could “possibly save the world’s food supply”./*~*/“Yet, we did not despair and eventually started testing on winged virgin queens and males of the ant species./*~*/Although ants usually lose their wings after the queen has been inseminated and starts to give birth to the new colony, genetic manipulation has produced a flying ant species that is strikingly similar to the common honey bee, and 50 times stronger to certain types of pesticides” he acknowledges, visibly enthused by the discovery./*~*/According to a recent Greenpeace study, seventy out of the top 100 human food crops, which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition, are pollinated by bees./*~*/US National Agriculture Statistics show a honey bee decline from about 3.2 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a 90% reduction./*~*/Related Articles/*~*/
