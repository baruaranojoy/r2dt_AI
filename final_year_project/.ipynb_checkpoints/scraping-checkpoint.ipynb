      "Vaping can damage vital immune system cells and may be more harmful than previously thought, a study suggests. \n",
      "Researchers found e-cigarette vapour disabled important immune cells in the lung and boosted inflammation.\n",
      "The researchers \"caution against the widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe\".\n",
      "However, Public Health England advises they are much less harmful than smoking and people should not hesitate to use them as an aid to giving up cigarettes.\n",
      "The small experimental study, led by Prof David Thickett, at the University of Birmingham, is published online in the journal Thorax.\n",
      "Previous studies have focused on the chemical composition of e-cigarette liquid before it is vaped.\n",
      "In this study, the researchers devised a mechanical procedure to mimic vaping in the laboratory, using lung tissue samples provided by eight non-smokers.\n",
      "They found vapour caused inflammation and impaired the activity of alveolar macrophages, cells that remove potentially damaging dust particles, bacteria and allergens.\n",
      "They said some of the effects were similar to those seen in regular smokers and people with chronic lung disease.\n",
      "They caution the results are only in laboratory conditions and advise further research is needed to better understand the long-term health impact - the changes recorded took place only over 48 hours. \n",
      "An independent review of the latest evidence on e-cigarettes was published by Public Health England in February.\n",
      "The review concluded there was \"overwhelming evidence\" they were far safer than smoking and \"of negligible risk to bystanders\" and advised they should be available on prescription because of how successful they had been in helping people give up smoking.\n",
      "Prof Thickett said while e-cigarettes were safer than traditional cigarettes, they may still be harmful in the long-term as research was in its infancy.\n",
      "\"In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens,\" he said.\n",
      "\"They are safer in terms of cancer risk - but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], then that's something we need to know about.\n",
      "\"I don't believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes - but we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe.\"\n",
      "Martin Dockrell, tobacco control lead at Public Health England, said: \"E-cigarettes are not 100% risk-free but they are clearly much less harmful than smoking. \n",
      "\"Any smoker considering e-cigarettes should switch completely without delay.\"\n",
      "A former Catholic archbishop will serve a maximum 12-month sentence in home detention for concealing child sexual abuse, an Australian court has ruled.\n",
      "The decision means Philip Wilson, who resigned as archbishop of Adelaide after his conviction, will avoid jail.\n",
      "Wilson, 67, is the world's most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of covering up sexual abuse. \n",
      "His lawyers said they would lodge an appeal on Tuesday. \n",
      "A magistrate said Wilson would commence his sentence immediately at a relative's home, where he would be monitored by a tracking device. He will be eligible for parole after six months.\n",
      "As he left court on Tuesday, Wilson did not respond to an abuse survivor who confronted him to demand an apology.\n",
      "During his trial, Wilson denied knowing that paedophile priest James Patrick Fletcher had abused altar boys in the 1970s.\n",
      "However, the court ruled in May that Wilson had been alerted to the abuse by victims, and failed to report it. \n",
      "Fletcher was convicted of nine child sexual abuse charges in 2004, and died in jail in 2006.\n",
      "Magistrate Robert Stone said Wilson had stayed silent out of a desire to protect the Church's reputation.\n",
      "Last month, he ordered Wilson to be assessed for home detention. Magistrate Stone said the senior clergyman had shown \"no remorse or contrition\" during the trial. \n",
      "On Tuesday one of Fletcher's victims, Peter Gogarty, approached Wilson to call for an apology.\n",
      "He remained silent, but one of his supporters confronted Mr Gogarty. \"I haven't got time for rubbish like you, mate,\" the supporter said, Australian media reported.\n",
      "Mr Gogarty later told reporters: \"We've just had another representative of the Catholic Church basically call me dirt.\"\n",
      "\"The archbishop does not have a single, solitary word to say to anybody like me that says 'sorry for your suffering'.\"\n",
      "Wilson resigned as archbishop last month, days after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called for him to be sacked by Pope Francis.\n",
      "He remains an ordained bishop but has no official role.\n",
      "A boy whose remains were found in a remote desert compound in New Mexico died during a \"ritual ceremony\", US prosecutors said.\n",
      "The boy's remains were discovered after police rescued 11 malnourished children who were being held at the site.\n",
      "Five adults have been arrested on charges of abusing the children - charges they have denied.\n",
      "The district judge granted all five bail, ruling the prosecution had not conclusively proven they were a threat. \n",
      "Defence lawyers have argued that the prosecution are treating the five suspects unfairly because they are Muslim - something prosecutors deny.\n",
      "Police raided the compound, near Amalia, on 6 August as part of their search for a missing three-year-old boy, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj. \n",
      "Abdul-Ghani was not among the 11 children rescued from the compound - but police later found the remains of a young boy there. \n",
      "Abdul-Ghani's father, Siraj Wahhaj,  is suspected of abducting the boy from his Georgia home in December. \n",
      "He was arrested at the site, along with Lucas Morten, Jany Leveille, Hujhrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj.\n",
      "Prosecutors had argued that the five were dangerous and should not be granted bail, because they had trained the children to use weapons and carry out school shootings. \n",
      "They also said that the remains found at the site belonged to Abdul-Ghani and that the other children said the boy had died during a \"religious ritual... intended to cast out demonic spirits\", where Siraj Wahhaj had put his hand to his son's forehead, and recited verses from the Koran.  \n",
      "Abdul-Ghani suffered from seizures, but Mr Wahhaj believed the boy was possessed by the devil and needed to be exorcised, court papers said. \n",
      "An FBI agent told the court that after Abdul-Ghani died, the children were told he would return \"as Jesus\" and tell them where to carry out attacks, an FBI agent told the court.\n",
      "However, Judge Sarah Backus said that while the information she had heard was \"troubling\", prosecutors had not proved that the defendants posed a threat to the wider community.\n",
      "\"The state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was,\" she said. \n",
      "All five must wear ankle monitors and have weekly contact with their lawyers on bail, she ordered. \n",
      "Defence lawyer Thomas Clark said the prosecution was using a double standard because the suspects are \"black and Muslim\". \n",
      "\"If these people were white and Christian, nobody would bat an eye over the idea of faith healing, or praying over a body or touching a body and quoting scripture,\" he said.\n",
      "He criticised the prosecution for what he said were suggestions that \"when black Muslims do it, there seems to be something nefarious, something evil\".\n",
      "The discovery of the 11 children earlier this month had shocked many in the US. \n",
      "Officers who discovered the children said they looked \"like Third World country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing\".\n",
      "Authorities had raided the site after receiving a message from someone that read: \"We are starving and need food and water.\"\n",

      "A white man who shot and killed an unarmed black man over a parking dispute in Florida has now been charged with manslaughter, prosecutors say.\n",
      "Michael Drejka, 47, shot Markeis McGlockton after a fight broke out over a disabled parking space on 19 July.\n",
      "He was not immediately arrested due to the state's \"stand your ground\" law, which protects those claiming self-defence after a violent incident.\n",
      "Police arrested him on Monday. His bail has been set at $100,000 (£78,000).\n",
      "Pinellas County State Attorney Bernie McCabe said his office \"filed the charge we think we can prove\", the Tampa Bay Times newspaper reported.\n",
      "He did not offer further comment about the case.\n",
      "According to the arrest warrant, viewed by the Times, police noted Mr McGlockton had immediately stepped back \"when confronted with the firearm\" and turned away from Mr Drejka.\n",
      "Investigators also found Mr Drejka was around 12 ft (3.6m) away from Mr McGlockton when he shot him.\n",
      "Mr McGlockton's family said in a statement that the arrest was \"a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning,\" US media reported.\n",
      "\"While this decision cannot bring back our partner, our son, our father, we take solace in knowing our voices are being heard as we work for justice.\n",
      "\"This man killed Markeis in cold blood, without a second thought about the devastating impact his actions would have on our family, but this charge gives us a measure of hope that the truth will win and justice will prevail in the end.\"\n",
      "The family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump - who also represented the family of Trayvon Martin - said in a statement on Monday \"it's about time\" Mr Drejka was arrested.\n",
      "\"This self-appointed wannabe cop attempted to hide behind 'Stand Your Ground' to defend his indefensible actions, but the truth has finally cut through the noise,\" Mr Crump said. \n",
      "Florida's \"stand your ground\" or \"shoot first\" law gives protection from criminal prosecution or civil liability to people who claim self-defence after a shooting or violent incident.\n",
      "Police faced criticism for the initial decision not to charge Mr Drejka in July.\n",
      "\"I don't make the law. I enforce the law,\" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri had said at the time. \n",
      "\"I'm going to enforce it the way it's written. Others can have the debate about whether they like it or not.\"\n",
      "Mr Gualtieri had forwarded the case to the state attorney's office on 1 Aug.\n",
      "In a statement on Monday, Mr Gualtieri said: \"I support the State Attorney's decision and will have no further comment as the case continues to work its way through the criminal justice system.\"\n",
      "Mr Drejka was shoved over by Mr McGlockton after he confronted his girlfriend who was parked in a space for the disabled.\n",
      "Footage of the shooting was recorded on CCTV outside the convenience store and shows Mr McGlockton rushing back inside the building while clutching his chest.\n",
      "Witnesses say he then collapsed before shoppers called 911. He was taken to hospital in the city of Clearwater and pronounced dead.\n",
      "The police say Mr Drejka was co-operative when they arrived and had a valid concealed weapons licence.\n",
      "A man accused of a string of murders, rapes and burglaries in California as the so-called Golden State Killer has been charged with another murder.\n",
      "Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, has now been charged with 13 murders after his DNA was allegedly linked to the crimes.\n",
      "Investigators accused the suspect of killing a 16-year-old girl's father after he tried to intervene in a 1975 attempted kidnapping.\n",
      "The Golden State Killer terrorised California in the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
      "Mr DeAngelo, a former police officer, is accused of murdering Claude Snelling, 45, in the backyard of his home in Visalia, California.\n",
      "Mr Snelling was shot and killed while trying to save his 16-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Hupp, from a man attempting to abduct her.\n",
      "Ms Hupp described to KFSN-TV what happened on that night 42 years ago.\n",
      "She said that she remembered being woken up by a man in a ski mask, and that her father had seen from a window in the kitchen that she was being led out of the home by a man.\n",
      "\"He couldn't believe what he was seeing and he just charged out the back door and the man pushed me down,\" Ms Hupp said. \n",
      "\"And he shot my dad twice and then took off running.\"\n",
      "Mr Snelling was a journalism professor at the College of the Sequoias.\n",
      "The murder was originally attributed to a man that police had nicknamed the Visalia Ransacker, who had been linked to more than 85 burglaries in Tulare County, California.\n",
      "But with DNA evidence, investigators now believe the crimes were committed by the same suspect that had been called \"the Golden State Killer\" in other parts of the state.\n",
      "\"With this filing, we have officially linked the Visalia Ransacker to an individual known as the East Area Rapist and, tragically, the Golden State Killer,\" said Tim Ward, Tulare County district attorney. \n",
      "Mr DeAngelo is in a Sacramento County jail and is accused of several other rapes and murders throughout the state in the 1970s and 80s.\n",
      "The former police officer, Vietnam War veteran and auto mechanic was arrested in April after police tracked him down by matching his DNA with a genealogy website.\n",
      "He had been accused of killing 12 and raping 45 people between 1975 and 1986 before suddenly ending his crime spree.\n",
      "Each of the first degree murder counts carries a maximum sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.\n",

      "Mr Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said in a statement that FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered the firing on Friday.\n",
      "He said the sacking overruled a decision by the head of FBI employee discipline, who determined that Mr Strzok should only face a demotion and a 60-day suspension.\n",
      "\"The decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical Bureau practice, but also contradicts Director [Christopher] Wray's testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,\" Mr Goelman said in a statement on Monday. \n",
      "\"This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans. A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok's personal views ever affected his work.\"\n",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI told the BBC that they could not immediately comment on Mr Strzok's firing. \n",
      "Mr Trump took to Twitter on Monday to ask when the inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, which is being led by ex-FBI director Robert Mueller, will end.\n",

      "\"So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!\"\n",
      "In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr Strzok - a 21-year veteran of the FBI - asserted there was \"no evidence of bias in my professional actions\".\n",
      "He was repeatedly attacked by Republican lawmakers, and expressed \"significant regret\" for the texts.\n",
      "Under FBI regulations, agents may express political opinions \"as an individual\". It is not clear whether these texts were sent from work phones.\n",
      "Amid Republican criticism last year, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he was confident the special counsel team was being run \"appropriately\".\n",

      "WASHINGTON—In response to former aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman releasing a conversation between the two of them that he didn’t know was being taped, President Donald Trump reportedly condemned White House staffers’ use of a secret recording studio Monday. “I’m shocked and completely furious that people who I generously gave jobs in my administration would turn around and use a secret recording studio during meetings,” said the president, criticizing staffers who constructed a soundproof live room, vocal isolation booth, and mixing console in the West Wing to record, monitor, and master his statements in high fidelity without his knowledge. “I trusted these people not to sit me down and do a soundcheck, request that I do multiple takes, and play back my statements in the room until everyone agrees we’ve got what we’re looking for. I had no idea Omarosa was making suggestions about my microphone placement in between working with the audio engineer during takes, and, frankly, it’s a disgrace.” At press time, Trump criticized the anonymous leak by someone in his administration of a previously unreleased 13,680-hour recording of his entire presidency on iTunes and Spotify.\n",

      "FRIDAY HARBOR, WA—Saying that the unusual behavior was in fact a natural expression of the animal’s relationship to both its dead kin and its social environment, experts at the Center for Whale Research held a dockside press conference Monday to confirm that the orca who carried around her dead calf for two weeks did so as a warning to all who would defy her. “This is clearly an expression of the orca’s implacable will and physical power, though it is something even field researchers don’t see very often, as orcas tend to be extremely private concerning their desire for swift and bloody vengeance,” said marine biologist Julia Reyes, who noted the dead orca calf had most likely disrespected the authority of the mother whale and paid the ultimate price for its insolence. “We often witness orca mothers exhibiting ‘don’t fuck with me’ behavior, but this may be the first time an orca has made this attitude visible to human beings. She may be sending a message that, if we don’t comport ourselves correctly, we too will be dragged around the ocean for a couple weeks, just like her presumably smartassed calf. It’s absolutely incredible to behold.” Moments after Reyes’ statement, the orca breached the surface of the ocean behind Reyes and dragged her screaming and bleeding beneath the waves in response to the researcher’s remarks.\n",

My parents made me go outside and hurt people every day, and I’m much better for it.” Andrew refused to comment at length on his mother’s remarks, though he has reportedly often been heard responding to his mother by saying “Video games don’t even work like that, Mom.”\n",

Proponents of the nativist movement that promotes the racial superiority and purity of whites were observed gathering en masse on public transportation, patronizing coffee shops, during elevator rides, dropping off their children at schools, and otherwise assembling peacefully in nearly every American community to take part in normal, but quietly racist, daily activities. Reports confirmed that the white supremacists could be seen marching shoulder to shoulder along the nation’s streets to conduct personal banking, drop off or pick up their dry cleaning, buy groceries, and even attend box-office smash hit Mamma Mia!

Also, I don’t care what this cave painting says—the mammoth would totally prevail unless it got, like, stuck in a tar pit.” Whitley refused to comment on the discovery of a second, somewhat more realistic mural, which seems to ask the question of how many Cro-Magnons it would take to drive the Neanderthals extinct.\n",

Of course, there are now even more choices to make in the more realistic endgame: you can always sell your farm back to the bank at a massive loss and become a laborer at the fracking camps in Cindersap Forest, or brew the new moonshine and grain alcohol crafting items and drink yourself to death at Stardrop Saloon.” Farrow added that the expansion would also include an expanded weather system in which climate change will slowly transform the fertile valley into an arid wasteland.\n",
