Content :Stocks continued to pare losses Monday afternoon as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting that starts tomorrow and key economic data later this week. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were off 0.2%. Volume was down 18% on the Nasdaq and was little changed on the NYSE compared to the same time Friday. Russian Internet portal Yandex ( YNDX ) took the biggest hit among IBD 50 stocks, sinking 4%. Company co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich died Sunday of cancer after slipping into a coma last week. He was 48. Elsewhere, Chinese Internet portal Sohu.com ( SOHU ) plunged 9% on weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue. Volume was huge as the stock sliced through its 50-day line and fell 8% below a 68.41 buy point of an irregular base. That was enough to trigger a key IBD sell rule for investors who bought at the breakout. SouFun Holdings ( SFUN ), another Chinese stock, fell 6% after hitting a new high Friday. But it's still extended 22% from a 27.90 buy point. The real-estate listings website triggered the eight-week hold rule earlier this month after jumping more than 20% above the buy point in less than three weeks. Stocks that rise that much within three weeks of a breakout should be held for at least eight weeks because they're potential big winners. On the upside, IBD 50 stock Actavis ( ACT ) climbed 1% to a new high in heavy volume, adding to its breakout from a 133.10 buy point. On Friday, the developer of generic and branded drugs said Q2 profit rose 42%, edging above expectations, on a 47% jump in sales. Both figures were the best in five quarters.
