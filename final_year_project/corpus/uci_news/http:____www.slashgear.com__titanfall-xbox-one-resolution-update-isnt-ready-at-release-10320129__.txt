Content :A post-release Titanfall patch for Xbox One, upgrading the game’s graphics from the 792p of the beta that disappointed many early players. Although Titanfall for PC runs at 1080p, the Xbox One version of the game drops the resolution down considerably, something gamers had hoped would be addressed by the time the title reached store shelves. Unfortunately, according to the Titanfall developers, a fix won’t come until after the Tuesday release. “We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” Respawen lead engineer Richard Baker told Eurogamer . The issue, Baker claims, is one of eSRAM, which has already limited some multiplayer games in what resolution they can output. Respawn is still undecided on how it will address the shortcoming. “One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use,” Baker explained, “so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target.” That could end up with 1080p support on Xbox One, though non-anti-aliased, or alternatively 900p with FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing) support. “We don’t want to give up anything for higher res” Baker points out. While the core resolution hasn’t changed from Xbox One Titanfall beta to shipping release, the engineer insists that some graphical optimizations have been carried out and that the final game should look better than it did before. There’s no specific timescale for the post-launch resolution update.
