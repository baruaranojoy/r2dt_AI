Content :Yesterday, we told you of a deal at Best Buy this week where if you purchase Titanfall and a special Titanfall branded 12+1 Month Xbox Live Gold Membership card, you would save $15. However, unless you specifically want to buy it at Best Buy due to having store credit or something, Target has a better deal for you. If you purchase Titanfall this week along with the Titanfall branded 12+1 Month Xbox Live Gold Membership at the same time at Target , you will save $30. This essentially means you would be getting one of the two products for half price with the purchase of the other, which is a fantastic deal. You can get both for only $89.99, before tax of course. This deal runs through this Saturday, March 15, so donâ€™t miss out!
