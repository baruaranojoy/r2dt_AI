Content :A few months after the launch of the latest generation of game consoles, Sony's Play Station 4 has outsold Microsoft's Xbox One 3-1. One of the main reason is the price- PlayStation 4's list price is $399 at launch, $100 less than the Xbox One. Also, the PS4 is available in 57 countries, while you can buy an Xbox in only 13. Exclusive games are the biggest differentiator between game consoles, so far neither console has a must-have game to persuade users to buy a new system. But that could change next week with the release of Titanfall , a game exclusive to the Xbox. Titanfall , set to release on March 11 for Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC, is poised to become one of the biggest games of the year, and it will almost certainly help drive sales of the Xbox One. The open beta for the game, which ran from Feb. 15 to Feb. 19, attracted around 2 million players, and Titanfall could end up being the first "must-have" game for either console. Recently Microsoft announced that the upcoming game Titanfall will be bundled with the Xbox One. If you pre-order at the Microsoft Store by 12PM PST on March 8th, you'll receive the console bundle on March 11. Priced at $499.99, it's actually the same price as the Standard Edition Xbox One console. It will also be available at Best Buy , GameStop , Walmart and Amazon.com . Titanfall for Xbox 360 costs $59.99 on GameStop and Amazon , the release date is set on March 25. Now available for pre-order, the bundle includes: Download code for a digital copy of "Titanfall" Standard Xbox One console and Kinect sensor Standard Xbox One wireless controller Standard Xbox One Chat Headset One month Xbox Live Gold membership
