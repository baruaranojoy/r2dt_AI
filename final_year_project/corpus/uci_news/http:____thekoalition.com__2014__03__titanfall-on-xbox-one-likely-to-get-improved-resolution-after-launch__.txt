Content :Respawn have today revealed that the Xbox One version of Titanfall will likely see some improvement to the 720p resolution that the game currently has. Lead engineer Richard Baker at Respawn spoke with Eurogamer and said: “The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimize…we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 percent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship. “A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There’s still room for optimization and we’re still working on it. Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 [fps] all the time when we shipped but obviously when there’s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects… we’re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.” It is nice that they are going to try and improve the resolution after launch, however I am not sure it is entirely needed. In my opinion the game looked fine in the beta and people should be satisfied with the gameplay instead of focusing on the resolution. I do understand that the technical side is important to some people, but all it boils down to is internet arguments where people compare games based on how many pixels it has, which is not very important compared to how the game actually plays. Anyway, let me know in the comments below if you agree/disagree with me on this subject. Do you think people are putting too much importance on game resolutions? Thomas Chamberlain
