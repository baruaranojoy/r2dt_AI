Content :Titanfall players opting for physical copies of the game rather than a digital download should be prepared for a small(ish) update before they begin pumping lead this week. The patch, spotted by a Reddit user who has already gotten their hands on the game, is only 840MB so shouldn't cause too much of a delay for those with a decent internet connection. Dead Rising 3 opted for a similar measure in preparation for its Operation Broken Eagle DLC, though this required a much larger 16GB download. Gamers buying Titanfall digitally will not be affected. In other pre-launch news it seems that live-action content surrounding the title is on the way, with the website yourtitanisready.com having popped up - a collaboration between Respawn Entertainment and visual effects studio Playfight, the details of which have yet to be announced. "Titanfall is set in a rich near future universe with visceral, epic battles with Pilots and their Titan companions," Respawn said. "We wanted to partner with Playfight, who has a history of delivering movies that meld gameplay, live action and stellar CG into truly entertaining media, for Titanfall. What this collaboration brings is yet to unfoldâ€¦" The game will be released on Xbox One and PC in North America on 11 March and in Europe on 13 March. The Xbox 360 release date has been pushed back to 25 March (US) and 28 March (Europe).
