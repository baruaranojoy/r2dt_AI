Content :McDonald's () shares fell on Monday after reporting disappointing same store sales results for February as U.S. comparable sales declined 1.4% --- the fourth straight month of declines despite aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games. The world's largest fast food chain said global comparable sales decreased by 0.3% last month, as Europe same store sales increased 0.6% while the metric in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan, as well as by a stronger dollar, which makes its food more expensive overseas. "We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's CFO Pete Bensen in a statement announcing the sales figures this morning. "Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth." The company said that systemwide sales globally, which includes sales at all restaurants whether operated by McDonald's or its franchisees, would have increased 2.2% if not for the weight of the stronger dollar instead of a 0.6% decline in February. The burger chain blamed weakness in the U.S. last month, on top of a same store sales drop of 3.3% in January, on "challenging industry dynamics" and the harsh winter weather, while European sales were bolstered by the U.K. and France, mostly offsetting poor performance in Germany. Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonaldâ€™s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed. Shares of McDonald's were down 0.3% on Monday morning, at US$95.24, stretching year-to-date losses to almost 2%. Share The Company is a publisher.
