Content :Sherman Oaks-based videogame developer Respawn Entertainment , headed by Vince Zampella, is launching its new title, Titanfall at midnight, in what has been billed as a potential game changer for Microsoft's Xbox One . Microsoft is apparently counting on Titanfall to be the next "Halo"--a game which defines a reason to acquire the new Xbox One. Respawn's Zampella was behind the immensely successful Call of Duty titles. Electronic Arts is publishing Titanfall.
