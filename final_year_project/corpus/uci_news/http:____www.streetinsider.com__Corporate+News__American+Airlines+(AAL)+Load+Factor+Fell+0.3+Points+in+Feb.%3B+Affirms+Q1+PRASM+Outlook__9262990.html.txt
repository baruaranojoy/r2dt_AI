Total capacity was 19.2 billion available seat miles (ASMs), up 0.8 percent versus February 2013. Total passenger load factor was 78.4 percent for the month of February, down 0.3 points versus February 2013. During the first two months of the year, the company's operations were significantly impacted by severe weather at its hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. In February, the company canceled more than 14,000 flights, up 149 percent versus February 2013. In the first two months of 2014, the company canceled approximately 28,000 flights, a 164 percent increase over the same period in 2013. The company believes the weather-related cancellations had a slightly positive impact on unit revenue but had a larger negative impact on unit cost and first quarter profitability. The company expects to disclose an estimate of the one-time profitability impact in early April. Despite these weather-related difficulties, unit revenue remains strong and the company continues to expect first quarter 2014 PRASM to be up approximately 2 percent to 4 percent versus first quarter 2013. The following summarizes American Airlines Group traffic results for the month and year-to-date ended Feb. 28, 2014 and 2013, consisting of mainline-operated flights, wholly owned regional subsidiaries and operating results from capacity purchase agreements. The company believes it is more meaningful to compare year-over-year results for American Airlines and US Airways on a combined basis. Accordingly, the traffic results provided above and in the enclosed table combine the traffic results for AMR Corporation and US Airways Group for all periods presented.
