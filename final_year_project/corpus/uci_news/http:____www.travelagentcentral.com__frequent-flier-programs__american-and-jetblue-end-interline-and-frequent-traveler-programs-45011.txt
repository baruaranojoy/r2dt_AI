Content :The American Airlines and US Airways merger has given the new American Airlines more robust service offerings in the northeastern U.S., the newly combined airline said. So today, American Airlines ( www.aa.com ) announced in a press release that it will terminate its interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program with JetBlue Airways ( www.jetblue.com) . That agreement covered select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Travel Industry Exchange is the leading one-to-one event featuring a product-focused conference, networking and entertainment. Top agents vie for coveted hosted positions to leverage valuable supplier content that will help improve personal growth and increase overall sales. Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier, the American press release said. In addition, effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline. All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and are not affected, said American. American also said the two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.
