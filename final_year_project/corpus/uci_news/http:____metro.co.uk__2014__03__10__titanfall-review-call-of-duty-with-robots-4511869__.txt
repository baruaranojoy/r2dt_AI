Content :Titanfall (XO) – everything is better in a giant robot suitIt’s the game that could make or break the Xbox One, but does this new FPS have what it takes to be the next gen’s biggest shooter? We’re now a good few months into the next generation of consoles and so far there have been very few games to justify spending hundreds on new hardware. Titanfall is one of the first games to promise both and its success or failure will have a profound effect on the future of the new consoles… Of course the one element of Titanfall that has already been a success is its marketing campaign, which is the primarily reason the stakes have been raised to this level. Although we use the term ‘Call Of Duty with robots’ partly in jest that does go a long way towards summing up its appeal. Developer Respawn was founded by two of the co-creators of Call Of Duty ( although one left almost immediately ) and is staffed by many ex-Infinity Ward veterans. It’s therefore no surprise to find that as a close quarters first person shooter Titanfall doesn’t put a foot wrong. It’s also no surprise to find it handles very similarly to Call Of Duty, with the same silky smooth movement and as precise as aiming as the Xbox One controller will allow (in fact more so, given that Respawn got Microsoft to adjust the sensitivity just for them ). But the on-foot combat is not limited to simply running around on the ground, as all the human characters (referred to as Pilots) are equipped with a short-range jetpack. It doesn’t exactly make you the Rocketeer though, and it’s really just an excuse to explain why you can double jump and wall run like Prince of Persia. Using these new parkour powers takes a lot of practise, and at first it seems all but impossible to do anything but jump onto and into buildings. But as you learn the layout of the maps you realise that what at first seemed to be randomly placed billboards or debris are actually carefully positioned to allow you to traverse the entire map almost without touching the ground. Titanfall (XO) – leap small buildings with a single boundYour weaponry as a Pilot is relatively mundane by shooter standards, especially as this is meant to be a sci-fi game, with the much talked about smart pistol (which can automatically lock on to nearby targets) being one of the few deviations from the norm. There are some interesting gadgets to kit yourself out with though, including an upgradeable cloaking device and a very handy x-ray radar pulse. There are also single use ‘burn cards’, which confer one shot bonuses like extra speed, over-powered weapons, and score multipliers. The weapons for the robot exoskeletons (the eponymous titans) are a little more out there, including what is essentially a lightning gun, but the game goes to great lengths not to bombard players with any more sci-fi hardware than it has too. There are a few reasons for this, including the current dominance of modern day military shooters, but the main one is making sure that nobody starts to think that jumping in and out of 20 foot robots is silly. While the parkour antics take some getting used to controlling a titan is extremely easy. The controls are almost identical to being on foot, except you’re a little slower (more or less so depending on which of the three models you’re piloting) and you can only dash instead of jump. Otherwise though you’re almost as manoeuvrable as a Pilot, except you can now step on other people and you’re wielding guns the size of smart cars. But controlling a titan has the opposite learning curve to being a Pilot: while the controls are instantly accessible the tactical implications of being a big giant robot are less clear. At first of course you just march into battle assuming you’re invincible but although you can certainly survive several hits you still won’t last long under a concentrated attack – especially as every Pilot is armed with their own anti-titan weapon. We played the game over a period of two days (so roughly 14 hours of playtime) and it was fascinating to see the different tactics that evolved over that time. Some took to sniping from afar, while others largely gave up with the titan and just kept it in guard or follow mode as they continued on foot. In fact we can pinpoint the exact moment we fell in love with Titanfall: it was on the Lagoon map in a standard Attrition match (basically Team Deathmatch). We’d opted for the all-rounder Atlas chassis, with a tank-like 40mm cannon, a smoke generator, and heat-seeking missiles. This is always the most humiliating way to go out, so we turned on the smoke generator (which is specifically designed to also damage Pilots), got outside to shotgun him off the titan’s back, jumped back in and then used the gas as cover to batter another titan that had strayed too close – ripping the Pilot out from inside of it. This then triggered a time-limited period of extra damage where we got to beat up on two more titans before ejecting and making use of a burn card that added extra damage to a death knell explosion that took out the two new interlopers. Titanfall (XO) – Stryders are the fast-but-weak titans, Ogres are the slow-but-strong onesIt’s probably a good job that that the mic on the headphones we were using didn’t work properly, because we’re pretty sure we roared (well, probably eeked) in triumph at that point. And if we’d had a can of engine oil to hand we would’ve have splashed it on our face as a sign of our robot virility. That was the best killing streak we had in a titan but the whole game is filled with unrepeatable moments like that, from taking a jetpack shortcut to chase down an opponent in Capture the Flag to the obsession everyone at the review event got with trying to destroy the opposing dropship with a titan drop (allegedly it can be done, but no one actually managed it). In terms of gameplay Titanfall absolutely lives up to the hype, but there are several problems with the package as a whole – many of them seemingly due to having to meet this month’s release date. Although there’s a generous 15 maps included, all of a very high quality, there’s only five game modes: Attrition (aka Team Deathmatch), Hardpoint (aka Conquest), Capture the Flag, Last Titan Standing (a multi-round knockout match), and Pilot Hunter (just what it sounds like). The graphics are also largely unimpressive and there are frequent, if minor, problems with object pop-in and frame rate judder. But for the record we had four separate disconnection errors during the two days, with most of the people around us seeming to suffer a similar number. For example, the much talked about monsters that inhabit some levels are merely background details and only ever attack the computer-controlled characters – and only then rarely. You stand almost no danger of being killed by them and apart from offering up a few free experience points if you shoot them they serve no purpose other than to make the level look a little busier. Titanfall’s biggest misfire though is the campaign multiplayer, which is almost laughably awful. Before release Respawn kept talking about it as being the experience of a single-player story mode but with multiplayer gameplay. But there are no extra set pieces and only a few seconds of cut scene before a stage, which means that the entire storytelling effort relies on a bunch of clichéd characters jabbering on the radio. Titanfall (XO) – don’t bother watching out for the flying monstersIn fact you can very easily simulate Titanfall’s campaign multiplayer in any online shooter you like. Just get some family or friends to argue very loudly about something you have no interest in while you’re trying to play and bingo: instant campaign multiplayer. It’s not even as if winning or losing has any effect on the story, with the dialogue adapting slightly but the outcome never altering. It’s farcically poor and although the campaign multiplayer is only a minor part of the game it is a terrible bit of universe building. Together with the generic art design Titanfall has the least interesting backstory for any new game we can remember, with two sides fighting over vaguely implied goals (there’s a milita and an evil corporation that makes robots) that ends merely in a bit of sequel begging. Many will argue that this is still not a major step forward for the genre, and that Titanfall is still not a game that actually needs a next gen console. In Short: It could do with a few more ancillary options, and a more interesting backstory, but in terms of online gameplay Titanfall is now the game to beat this gen. Pros: Perfectly balanced gameplay, pin sharp controls, and a huge range of emergent tactics. 15 great maps and the titans themselves are excellent – as are the Pilots and their parkour skills. Plenty of maps, but the lack of game modes and customisation points to a hurried development schedule.
