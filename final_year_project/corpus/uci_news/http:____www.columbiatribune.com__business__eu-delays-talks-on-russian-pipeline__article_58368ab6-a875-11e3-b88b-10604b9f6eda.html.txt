Spokeswoman Sabine Berger said today the commission, the 28-country bloc's executive arm, will continue talks at a technical level but suspend planned political negotiations in light "of the broader developments" in the European Union's relations with Russia. The European Union last week suspended talks on visa liberalization and an economic pact with Moscow to protest against Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The South Stream pipeline, in which Russia's Gazprom holds a 50 percent stake, would provide an alternative supply route for Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria and Italy. It's expected to ship as much as 63 billion cubic meters of gas from 2018.
