Content :Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956. Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America. There were even more trips than in 2008 when gas prices rose to $4-$5 a gallon, and more Americans were opting out of driving, USA Today reports . The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs. The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.
