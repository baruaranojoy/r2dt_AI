Content :Electronic Arts’ hotly anticipated game “ Titanfall ” hasn’t even been released yet, but one insider claims it has already helped Microsoft sell approximately 1 million additional Xbox One consoles. In the early days of this generation’s “console war,” Sony’s popular PlayStation 4 has taken an early lead. At last count, Sony had sold 6 million PS4 consoles globally as of early March. Meanwhile, the last official number we got from Microsoft was 3 million Xbox One consoles sold worldwide through the end of 2013 . Some believe Microsoft’s silence speaks volumes, but a new report suggests Xbox One unit sales have ballooned dramatically thanks to the highly anticipated upcoming release of Titanfall. PlayStation news blog DualShockers directs us to a recent post on the NeoGAF forums from Pete “FamousMortimer” Dodd, an industry insider that the site says has a solid track record. In the post, Dodd claims that despite the fact that Titanfall hasn’t even launched yet, mounting anticipation for the mech-style first-person shooter has already led to an addition 1 million Xbox One consoles having been sold in recent weeks. “Marketing guys project that Titanfall has already helped sell around 1 million Xbox Ones. This is based off of things like upticks in sales after every major Titanfall announcements,” Dodd wrote in his post on NeoGAF . “They don’t know if it will move 200k more at this point. The titanfall bundle is selling less than Microsoft projected (but they are still hopeful for a big swing come tuesday).”
