Content :Investing.com - Asian stock markets fell sharply on Monday, as
growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand
for riskier assets. During late Asian trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged
1.8%, China's Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86%, Australia's
ASX/200 Index closed 0.93% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index
ended down 1.01%. Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports
collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing
expectations for a 6.8% increase. The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of
$22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion
in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in
February. A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China
rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations,
while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts
for a 1.9% drop. Markets in mainland China and in Hong Kong came under heavy
selling pressure as shares in the financial sector sold off amid
worries about domestic bond defaults. In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank lost 1.7%, China CITIC
Bank shed 1.8%, while Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and
China Minsheng Bank slumped 1.5% and 2.5%. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Nikkei retreated after data showed that
Japan's economy grew by 0.2% in the final three months of 2013,
down from a preliminary estimate of 0.3%. On an annualized basis, the country's gross domestic product
rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, down from an initial estimate of
1%. The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar, with USD/JPY
falling to a daily low of 102.92, moving off the previous session's
high of 103.75. Automakers Toyota and Honda saw shares fall 1.15% and 2%
respectively, while index heavyweights Fanuc and Fast Retailing
dropped 2.6% and 1.85%. Elsewhere, in Australia, the ASX/200 Index ended lower as miners
came under pressure amid concerns over a slowdown in Chinese demand
for raw materials. Copper producers sold off as prices of the industrial metal fell
to a seven-month low. Atlas Iron and Fortescue Metals Group plunged
10.15% and 9.4%, while BHP Billiton dropped 4.15%. Australian commodity producers are heavily reliant on Chinese
demand for raw materials. Looking ahead, European stock market futures pointed to a mildly
lower open. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a loss of 0.25% at
the open, France's CAC 40 futures shed 0.1%, London's FTSE 100
futures indicated a decline of 0.3%, while Germany's DAX futures
slumped 0.5%. Across the Atlantic, U.S. equity markets also pointed to a
weaker open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a
fall of 0.3%, S&P 500 futures inched down 0.3%, while the
Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 0.25%. The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added
175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new
jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January,
as more people joined the workforce. The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic
data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the
Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its
bond-buying program. Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial
