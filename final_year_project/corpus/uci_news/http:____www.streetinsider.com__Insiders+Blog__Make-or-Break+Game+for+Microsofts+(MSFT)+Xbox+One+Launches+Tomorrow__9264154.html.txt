The game is due out on Tuesday and has already been generating considerable buzz among retailers and gamers alike. There are about 6,000 midnight launch events expected early Tuesday morning across the U.S. Microsoft is also going outside the norm by offering a free copy of the game to those buying an Xbox One for the first time. The console carries a base price of $499 and the game will sell by itself for $60. Titanfall will also be available on Xbox 360 and PC. Microsoft will provide servers that will power the games artificial intelligence, among other functions, via a users' Internet connection and a series of dedicated servers. This will allow the gaming consoles to focus more on rendering graphics and creating more-detailed animations. With its original Xbox console, Microsoft used a similar strategy with its Halo title, arguably one of the best-selling console games ever. The title spawned a series of sequels and spinoffs, all of which have done reasonably well. Despite the hype, Microsoft is largely lagging rival Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and its PlayStation 4 (PS4) in the console sales war. Last January, Microsoft said it shipped around 3 million Xbox One units and hasn't provided an update since. Sony's number is currently around 6 million PS4s or so. Microsoft shares are down modestly Monday.
