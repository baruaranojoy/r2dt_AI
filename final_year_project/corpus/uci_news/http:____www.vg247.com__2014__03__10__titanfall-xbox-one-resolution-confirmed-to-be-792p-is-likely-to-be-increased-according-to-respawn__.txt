Content :Titanfall comes out tomorrow, and other than fan claims , we’ve not heard the official word on the game’s resolution on Xbox One. That has now changed thanks to an interview with Respawn’s lead engineer Richard Baker. Speaking to Eurogamer , Baker confirmed that 792p is the same resolution as the beta and that they’re experimenting with several options to try an increase it, without compromising the frame-rate. “We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use, so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target. “The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship,” he said. FXAA and MSAA are both techniques of removing aliasing from the surfaces and edges in games, each come with its pros and cons. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.
