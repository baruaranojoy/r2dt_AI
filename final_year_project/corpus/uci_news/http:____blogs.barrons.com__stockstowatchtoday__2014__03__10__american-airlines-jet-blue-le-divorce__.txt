Last month, Wolfe Research's Hunter Keay stated his belief that the partnership between JetBlue ( JBLU ) and American Airlines ( AAL ) would come to an end . That day has finally come. American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp.agreed to end their partnership, which has been in effect since 2010.Starting Monday, the airlines will stop accepting new interline sales on the other carrier, while on April 1, customers will stop earning miles and points from each when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline. Customers' already-accrued miles and points won't be affected and will be credited to their accounts, the airlines said. Cowen'sHelane Becker and Conor Cunningham explain the significance for JetBlue and American Airlines: ...American Airlines and JetBlue announced they will terminate their partnership agreement. This is not a complete surprise as we expected US Airways could provide American the feed they need in New York. More to the point, we expect New York to be less important to American going forward as US Airways has a large hub in Philadelphia. The American Airlines interline agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program will be terminated on April 1. The two carriers had agreements on routes from Boston Logan and New York JFK airports. Neither company has announced the financial impact of the interline agreement; however, we believe the impact is more negative for JetBlue. Shares of JetBlue have fallen 1.4% to $8.90 at 1:27 p.m., while American Airlines has risen 0.1% to $39.06. Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) has fallen 0.8% to $35.09 and United Continental Holdings ( UAL ) is off 2.2% as $46.72.
