Content :Titanfall will see a decreased resolution at 720P when it launches, but the developers hope to change that in the future. According to Respawn, developers of Titanfall, the game will ship at a lower resolution than what they wanted. Fans were hoping for a 1080P game, but Respawn notes that too many corners needed to be cut to offer that. "We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA [multisample anti-aliasing] and instead using FXAA [fast approximate anti-aliasing] to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target," Baker told Eurogamer. He did note that the team is hard at work tweaking the engine and game to make it work in a way they are happy with. Due to that the resolution could very well improve in the future, but won't hit the target for launch. "We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimize... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 percent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it," he added. "For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship." Sony was in hot water when Killzone Shadow Fall was noted to drop "full 1080p" in order to achieve a steady 60FPS framerate. The problem here is that Titanfall also won't run at 60FPS. "We're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally," he said. Hopefully the team stays hard at work and can figure this out. The game is technically a launch title trying to fit into a time slot, so these issues are expected to happen. Titanfall releases tomorrow on the Xbox One and PC!
