Content :Respawn Entertainment has confirmed that Titanfall will launch at a native resolution of 792p on Xbox One. Lead Engineer Richard Baker confirmed the news that will probably lead to more “Xbox One is doomed” articles popping up because the game isn’t at 1080p. However, Baker did note that Respawn is looking into upping the resolution in the future. “We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” Baker revealed to Eurogamer . “One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we’re going to use, so we’re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don’t have to have this larger render target. “We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.” Resolution has become an argument between Xbox One and PS4 fanboys. Numerous Third-Party games on Xbox One have been observed running at a lower resolution than their PS4 counter-parts. Still, the game’s look good on both platforms despite a different in native resolution. Titanfall is out tomorrow, March 11 on Xbox One and PC. The Xbox 360 version is out March 25.
