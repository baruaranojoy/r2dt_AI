Content :Advertisement Titanfall is shipping with the same resolution it sported in the beta last month, but it might not stay that way. Pixel counters found the resolution of Titanfall in beta to be 792p, which was later confirmed by Respawn Community Manager Abbie Heppe, who mentioned that the game may ship with a higher resolution. That isn’t the case, but Respawn’s Lead Engineer Richard Baker says it might be on the horizon. “For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship,” he said in an interview with Eurogamer . The interview goes into some great technical detail for those with a deeper understanding of the ins and outs of anti-aliasing, but it seems like a lot of it comes down to the fact that the Xbox One is still a fairly new console and that even the teams releasing some of the core titles are still mastering it. The framerate, which was not consistently locked at 60fps during the beta, is still not locked. Baker says, though, that we can expect improved performance. “The worst case scenarios are better,” he says. For the deeper technical details, check out the full interview at Eurogamer .
