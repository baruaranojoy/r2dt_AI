A Metro-North employee was struck and killed by a train early Sunday morning, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In a news release, the MTA said the incident happened at 12:54 a.m. while the employee was working on the tracks at Park Avenue and East 106th Street in Manhattan. The worker was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His identity is being withheld while his family is notified, the MTA said. The Hudson Line train departed from Grand Central Terminal just a few minutes before the incident with approximately 50 passengers onboard. Those passengers were safely moved to another train at 2:17 a.m., according to the MTA. The incident was under investigation by Metro-North and the MTA Police Department. This was the latest in a string of incidents for the rail company. There were two derailments last year, one in Bridgeport that left dozens injured, the other in the Bronx where four people were killed. A Metro-North worker was also killed last year while performing maintenance work in West Haven. Copyright 2014 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
