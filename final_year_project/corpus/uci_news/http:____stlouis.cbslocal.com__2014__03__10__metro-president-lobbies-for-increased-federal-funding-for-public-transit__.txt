Content :WASHINGTON, D.C. (KMOX) – Public transportation officials are finally getting what they’ve long been pushing for—increased ridership. Now, they’ve got to find a way to pay for it. Metro president and CEO John Nations is in Washington, D.C. to lobby on behalf of the American Public Transportation Association. “Americans are riding at record numbers, ” he says. “We’re seeing demand that we have not seen since the 50s and the 60s, and we’re looking for a long-term funding solution. Historically, the federal government had made commitments for five or six years in a funding program.” He says in 2013 there were more than 10.5 billion trips taken on public buses and trains—the highest ridership levels since the mid-1950s. Nations will offer first-hand testimony on the explosive growth. Twice in the past 24 months St. Louis has led the nation in percentage growth for Metro bus and MetroLink riders. He and his group will urge members of Congress to increase federal funding for public transit so they can keep up with the growing number of riders.
