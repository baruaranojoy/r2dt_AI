Content :With the launch of Titanfall tomorrow, everywhere has deals revolving around it this week it seems like. This time it is Toys R Us’ turn with a great deal of their own, especially if you are looking to pick up another game as well. With the purchase of Titanfall for Xbox One, you will get 50% any other video game that is $59.99 or less. Essentially, you can get 50% off any game that isn’t a collector’s edition of some sort. This would be perfect for those who are looking to also get Dark Souls II at launch this week, or maybe South Park: The Stick of Truth from last week. There are certainly plenty of games to choose from to pair with the deal if you wish to do so. On top of that, you will also receive a free poster and $15 off a 12 month Xbox Live subscription, similar to the sale held by Best Buy. Just like the other sales, this one will run through Saturday, March 15, so get by your local Toys R Us before then, or see if the website is offering the deal starting on Tuesday.
