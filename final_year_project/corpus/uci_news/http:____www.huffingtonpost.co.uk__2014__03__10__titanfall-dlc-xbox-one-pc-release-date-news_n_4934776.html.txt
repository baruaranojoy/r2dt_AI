Content :Are you ready for Titanfall? EA and Respawn's first-person shooter and mech combat sim is almost ready to launch. And based on our own previews, and those few early reviews that have slipped through the cracks of the embargo, it looks like it's got a great chance of taking the gaming world by storm. In fact Titanfall is pretty much expected to be one of the best-selling and best-reviewed games of the year. But naturally as the game nears release you'll have a few questions about what to expect in terms of price, DLC and other details. Here's everything we know so far, in bite-size form. What Formats Will Titanfall Be Released In? Titanfall will be released for Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC. When Will Titanfall Be Released? Titanfall will be released in the UK on 14 March 2014. Prices vary by retailer, but look for it to cost about £50 in disc form for Xbox One, slightly more as a download, and slightly less on Xbox 360 and PC (especially though digital downloads). Is there an Xbox One bundle? There is! It's £400 for an Xbox One, controller, Kinect and copy of Titanfall. How long will it take to download? Titanfall weighs in at 20GB, with a day one patch of about 1GB, so depending on your internet connection it could take around four hours to download. There will be three DLC content packs costing about £7 each, or £20 for a season pass.
