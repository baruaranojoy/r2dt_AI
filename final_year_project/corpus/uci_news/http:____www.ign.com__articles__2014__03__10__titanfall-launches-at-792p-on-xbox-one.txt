By Luke Karmali Exit Theatre Mode Speaking to Eurogamer , Respawn lead engineer Richard baker confirmed that the possibility of upping the resolution was still being explored, though the team decided to err on the side of caution and release the beta version so as to avoid making sacrifices to gameplay. Exit Theatre Mode "We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower," he revealed. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. "We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship." This isn't to say no improvements have been made since beta; Baker confirmed that while the average is likely the same, the worst-case scenarios have been improved following feedback.
