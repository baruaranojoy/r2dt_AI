Content :Posted on March 10, 2014 by James Conway Titanfall at launch will be running in 792p for the Xbox One, the same resolution that the beta ran. Respawn Entertainment's lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed this with Eurogamer and said they were working on ways to improve the visuals after launch. "We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower. One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target," Baker said. "We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship." Titanfall comes out tomorrow for the Xbox One and PC. Get excited. #Titanfall,
