Content :NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stocks recovered most of their losses but still finished Monday generally lower as weak data from China reignited worries about a global economic slowdown.

Economists had expected an increase of 5%. The surprise drop also hit copper prices . “In the short term, China’s trade data was disappointing, however, at this point it is unclear how much of it was distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday,” said John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “U.S. equities still remain the market of choice for a lot of international money, which is why we have seen more multiple expansion over the past few weeks,” he added.
