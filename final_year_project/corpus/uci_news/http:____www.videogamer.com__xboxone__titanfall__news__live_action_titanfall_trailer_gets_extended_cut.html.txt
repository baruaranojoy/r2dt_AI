Content :The marketing campaign for EA and Respawn's Titanfall is trying to sell gamers on the idea that life would be better with a Titan in your life. A live action ad features a guy having a great time walking around a city with his Titan ensuring everything goes his way - that is until he comes across another guy who has a Titan too. The extended cut features around a minute more action than the one you'll see shown on TV. Titanfall launches tomorrow in the US and here in the UK on Friday. Look out for the VideoGamer review at 4pm GMT today. Source: Titanfall YouTube
