Content :Titanfall's last beta saw the game running at a native resolution of 792p , which was a bit unconventional for "next-gen" but certainly not 720p. Respawn has since confirmed that this will not change for the day one release of the Xbox One version of the game. While the news is somewhat unfortunate given Respawn had previously hoped to bump this up to somewhere closer to the 900p ballpark, it also quashes more negative rumors that the developer would be dialing back the native resolution to something even lower for retail launch. That doesn't mean Respawn has given up on trying to improve the native resolution in the near future, but lead engineer Richard Baker admits there's a juggling act in trying to fine tune just how much of an improvement they can realistically muster. Fortunately, Baker believes there is indeed room for further optimizations based on how Respawn leverages the Xbox One's ESRAM. What's important is not hamstringing anything else in the process! We're on the home stretch to Titanfall's release, be sure to check our impressions from the beta if you haven't already!
