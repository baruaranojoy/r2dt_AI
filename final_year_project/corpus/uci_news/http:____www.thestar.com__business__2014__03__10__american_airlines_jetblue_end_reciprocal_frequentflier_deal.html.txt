Content :NEW YORK—American Airlines and JetBlue Airways Corp. are ending an agreement that allowed travellers to add connections to their itinerary on each other’s aircraft. The termination of the interline sales agreement is effective Monday. The companies also said that they are ending a reciprocal frequent-flyer program accrual agreement. Travellers won’t earn miles or points when travelling on eligible routes run by the other airline beginning April 1. All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through the partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and are not affected. Last month Delta announced fundamental changes to its frequent-flier program. Starting next year, Delta customers will earn miles based on how much they spend, not just how far they fly. American Airlines Group Inc. is the holding company for American Airlines and US Airways. TOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.
