Content :We're only a day away from Titanfall 's launch , and it's hard to tell whether a successful launch means more to Respawn or Microsoft. EA hasn't been overly vocal about the title themselves, since either way, if Titanfall somehow falls short, it's not a major loss for the publisher. That doesn't mean it won't be a source of embarrassment for the other two companies. Microsoft's biggest investment into the development of the game was securing a deal with EA to make it an Xbox exclusive , but they've also been a driving force behind the various marketing campaigns for the title. Chief marketing and strategy officer Yusuf Medhi admits that Titanfall is "a game changer. It’s a system seller,” and that "it's hard to understate how incredibly important Titanfall is for Xbox." Not only would a successful launch for Titanfall potentially move Microsoft's product, but it might lead to a third-party exclusive franchise for the Xbox brand. The mech shooter will have a little bit of competition as far as exclusives are concerned since inFamous: Second Son also comes out this month for the PS4 on the March 21. On top of that, the PlayStation 4 has more first and third party support lined up compared to the Xbox One at the moment. The PS4 has also enjoyed much higher sales so far compared to its Western counterpart.
