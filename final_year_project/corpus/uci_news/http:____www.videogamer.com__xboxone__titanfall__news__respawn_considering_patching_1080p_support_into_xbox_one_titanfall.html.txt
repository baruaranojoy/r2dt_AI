Content :Respawn is considering increasing the native resolution of the Xbox One version of Titanfall to 1080p via a post-launch patch, lead engineer Richard Baker has told Digital Foundry . Until then, the game will render at 792p - the same resolution offered by the Xbox One beta. "We've been experimenting with making it higher and lower," said Baker. "One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we're going to use, so we're thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don't have to have this larger render target. "We're going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We're trying to optimise... we don't want to give up anything for higher res. So far we're not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we're still working on it. For day one it's not going to change. We're still looking at it for post-day one. We're likely to increase resolution after we ship." An increase in resolution isn't the only performance boost Titanfall could see post-release, either, with Baker suggesting that the frame-rate could still be tweaked, too. "A lot of the performance is on the GPU side," he continued. "There's still room for optimisation and we're still working on it. Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there's big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects... we're still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally." Titanfall launches on Xbox One and PC this Friday, March 14. Head back at 4pm today for our review.
