The CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings dived 3.3 per cent, hitting its lowest close since February 2, 2009. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 2.9 per cent at 1,999.1 points in its worst day since June 24. The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index of mainly high tech startups listed inShenzhen tumbled 3.7 per cent. China's consumer prices rose 2 per cent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a risk. Exports in February fell 18.1 per cent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 per cent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday. Imports rose 10.1 per cent, yielding a trade deficit of $US23 billion for the month versus a surplus of $US32 billion in January. Chinese shares sink on growth data fears
