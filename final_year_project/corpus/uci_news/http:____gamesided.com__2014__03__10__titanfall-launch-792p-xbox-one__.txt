Content :The Xbox One version of Titanall will have a 792p/60fps resolution when it launches this week, lead engineer Richard Baker revealed in an interview with Digital Foundry . Bake also stated that the game’s resolution was “likely” to increase after the game’s release. “We’ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,” he said. “We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change.” Whether it’s an increase to 900p or 1080p, the debate regarding game resolutions on the Xbox One will continue for months/years to come.
